abstract = {Conveying the intended goal of a robot arm motion has been shown to increase the quality of human-robot collaboration drastically. To this end, optimization-based approaches have been proposed that optimize the legibility of a robot’s motion. However, they are limited in two ways. First, they are typically not validated in environments with obstacles and narrow passages that require collision-free motion planning. Second, they do not consider the influence of the anthropomorphization process that might be caused by a human-like motion or appearance of the arm. This leads to the question of to what extent the legibility of motions is influenced by these factors. In this work, we study the influence of our previously proposed human-likeness function on the legibility of robot arm motions in the context of sampling-based motion planning. We evaluate it against three other motions: a functional motion, a recorded expert motion, and a legible motion based on a heuristic for the observer’s prediction. For this, we conduct an extensive user study with 94 participants. In contrast to other works, we manipulate the robot’s appearance and the complexity of the environment. We thus provide insights into how the legibility of robot motions is influenced by human-like characteristics in motion, appearance and restricting workspace conditions.

abstract = {The human-like motion of anthropomorphic arms can improve the efficiency of HRI (human-robot interaction). We propose a simple and easy-to-use human-like motion planning algorithm of anthropomorphic arms based on hierarchical strategy. By setting the trigger conditions of the end-effector's position and attitude, the motion of the robotic arm is divided into reaching stage and grasping stage. The end-effector velocity is planned using minimum jerk model, and a clamping function is applied to improve the smoothness of the motion. The inverse kinematics is solved using selectively damped least squares method, which can avoid singularities. To deal with the redundancy problem, a human-like pose optimization function based on the principle of minimum potential energy is defined, which is solved using gradient projection method. The simulation and experimental results show that the robotic arm achieves good human-like performance in both Cartesian space and joint space, confirming the effectiveness of the motion planning algorithm proposed in this paper.},

abstract = {Due to the body analogy and their ability to communicate also via body language, humanoid robots are discussed as being mostly fit for applications in service robotics. An essential precondition of their deployment in human environments is the generation and control of human-like and thus predictable motions. This contribution introduces new motion control strategies which are based on the "Rapid Upper Limb Assessment" (RULA), a method for the analysis of ergonomic conditions at manual workplaces. We have previously adapted RULA to work with the Virtual Human, a simulated anthropomorphic multiagent system for the analysis of human motions and manipulations. Enabled by the control framework behind the Virtual Human, we here transfer RULA to humanoids in general and propose it as a well-defined and transparent heuristic for the control of human-like motions.},
