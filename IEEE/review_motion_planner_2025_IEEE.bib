  abstract={Human-like motion is necessary for successful human-robot collaboration. To achieve human-like motion with generalization capability on a robotic arm, we use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to model the motion of the human arm, i.e., DMPs extract parameters from the trajectories involving position and orientation of the hand, the elbow elevation angle. When using DMPs for human-like motion generation, i.e., planning human-like motion trajectories for robotic arms, the DMPs must be provided with targets. The task performed provides targets of end-effector position and orientation for the DMPs. We use a deep neural network (DNN) to provide the target of elbow elevation angle. The proposed method is validated in a simulation environment, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the human-like level of the motion. The results indicate a high anthropomorphism of the robotic arm in performing generalized motions.},

  abstract={How to generate human-like arm extension motion is a challenging problem in the process of human-robot collaboration to understand and judge the robot's motion intention. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-task planning algorithm for human-like arm motion based on the energy principle and the joint limit avoidance principle. First, a motion capture device is used to collect human arm motion data to obtain guidelines for human arm motion characteristics. On the basis of analyzing the arm demonstration data, the gravitational potential energy and virtual elastic potential energy models of the arm are established, and the mapping from the virtual variable stiffness of the arm to the virtual variable stiffness of the robot is realized. An end-effector trajectory is generated based on a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) model and an optimization method, while a spherical linear interpolation (slerp) algorithm is used to generate the attitude sequence. In order to better execute the planned motion, the priority of the motion task is divided, and the design of two priority motion tasks is carried out by combining the gradient projection method. Finally, the humanoid arm motion multi-task planning algorithm proposed in this paper is simulated by simulation experiments, and the experimental results show that the method can generate the corresponding humanoid motions and has better motion accuracy.},

  abstract={At present, robots' autonomous ability is still very weak, hence improving the operation ability and human-robot interaction & collaboration capabilities is one of the primary goals for developing the anthropomorphic robots. In order to improve the human-like autonomy of anthropomorphic robots in dynamic and unstructured environments, namely, predictable and human-like motion planning, this paper proposes an on-line motion planning method for a humanoid mobile dual-arm manipulator system. It involves two aspects: autonomous placement of the mobile base (MB) and human-like motion planning of the MB and two arms. In particular, the two aspects are achieved by introducing two relative inverse dynamic reachability maps: RiDRM and LiDRM. Since the construction of RiDRM and LiDRM is mainly done offline, the online efficiency is guaranteed. In fact, if an obstacle is detected online, the maps RiDRM and LiDRM are updated by only disabling the candidate end-poses which are in collision. Furthermore, predictable and human-like movements are achieved by optimizing a merit function that considers five criteria simultaneously. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={The motor synergy pattern is an intrinsic characteristic found in natural human movements, particularly in the upper limb. It is essential to improve the multijoint coordination ability for stroke patients by integrating the synergy pattern into rehabilitation tasks and trajectory design. However, current robot-assisted rehabilitation systems tend to overlook the incorporation of a multijoint synergy model. This article proposes postural synergistic kernelized movement primitives (PSKMP) method for the human-like trajectory planning of robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation. First, the demonstrated trajectory obtained from the motion capture system is subject to principal component analysis to extract postural synergies. Then, the PSKMP is proposed by kernelizing the postural synergistic subspaces with the kernel treatment to preserve human natural movement characteristics. Finally, the rehabilitation trajectory accord with human motion habits can be generated based on generalized postural synergistic subspaces. This approach has undergone practical validation on an upper limb rehabilitation robot, and the experimental results show that the proposed method enables the generation of human-like trajectories adapted to new task points, in accordance with the natural movement style of human. This method holds great significance in promoting the recovery of coordination ability of stroke patients.},

  abstract={A novel motion planning method is proposed to generate human-like motion for anthropomorphic robot arms. Its highlight is to consider the robot arm to be human-like not only in its configuration but also in its motion patterns. To achieve this, the intrinsic mechanisms of human arm motion generation are transferred to robot motion planning. First, human arm motion is modeled using human arm motion primitives. The mechanisms of human arm motion generation are dissected from a large number of motion samples, reflected in the types, sequencing and quantification rules/laws of the primitives. Next, the human arm motion patterns are studied based on primitive chains. Finally, a new motion planning method is built that autonomously performs motion pattern decisions, motion time allocation, and joint trajectory generation. The proposed method is validated by a motion planning app and a robot simulation.},

  abstract={How to generate anthropomorphic reaching movement remains a challenging problem in service robots and human motor function repair/reconstruction equipment. However, there is no universally accepted computational model in the literature for reproducing the motion of the human upper limb. In response to the problem, this article presents a computational framework for generating reaching movement endowed with human motion characteristics that imitated the mechanism in the control and realization of human upper limb motions. This article first establishes the experimental paradigm of human upper limb functional movements and proposes the characterization of human upper limb movement characteristics and feature movement clustering methods in the joint space. Then, according to the specific task requirements of the upper limb, combined with the human sensorimotor model, the estimation method of the human upper limb natural postures was established. Next, a continuous task parametric model matching the characteristic motion class is established by using the Gaussian mixture regression method. The anthropomorphic motion generation method with the characteristics of the smooth trajectory and the ability of natural obstacle avoidance is proposed. Finally, the anthropomorphic motion generation method proposed in this article is verified by a human-like robot. The measurement index of the human-likeness degree of the trajectory is given. The experimental results show that for all four tested tasks, the human-likeness degrees were greater than 90.8%, and the trajectories’ jerk generated by this method is very similar to the trajectories’ jerk of humans, which validates the proposed method.},

  abstract={Humanoid robot is one of the most active frontiers in robotics. As the basic part of motion of humanoid robot, human-like motion planning is always one of the research hotspots and difficulties. In this paper, a comprehensive approach is proposed to help robot NAO generate the human-like arm movements. Firstly, a novel arm motion mode is built based on the Movement Primitives (MPs). The whole arm movement can be decoupled into different simple sub-movements with different motion models, which improves the accuracy and computational efficiency of human-like arm movements. Then a motion decision algorithm based on Bayesian Network (BN) is proposed to help robot NAO choose the suitable motion model among these MPs. Finally, according to the structure features of the MPs, the IK solutions can be classified into two categories: methods based on index and on geometrical constraints. Through the comprehensive approach, the robot NAO can generate various human-like arm movements with satisfactory accuracy. The availability of the approach is verified by similarity experiment and human-like movement experiment.},

  abstract={Facing and pointing toward moving targets is a usual and natural behavior in daily life. Social robots should be able to display such coordinated behaviors in order to interact naturally with people. For instance, a robot should be able to point and look at specific objects. This is why, a scheme to generate coordinated head-arm motion for a humanoid robot with two degrees-of-freedom for the head and seven for each arm is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a virtual plane approach is employed to generate the analytical solution of the head motion. A quadratic program (QP)-based method is exploited to formulate the coordinated dual-arm motion. To obtain the optimal solution, a simplified recurrent neural network is used to solve the QP problem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated using both computer simulation and physical experiments.},

  abstract={The robot manipulation in human environment is a challenging issue because the human environment is complex, dynamic, unstructured, and difficult to perceive reliably. In order to implement promising robot applications in our daily lives, robots need to perform manipulation tasks within human environment. Particularly for a humanoid robot, the manipulability of the objects is essential to assist the humans in human environment. This paper presents a method for manipulating an object with both arms of a humanoid robot. We focus on the generation of human-like movements by using the human motion capture data. Then, the control method based on the virtual dynamics model is proposed to control both the motion and force under the uniform control system. This method empowers the robot to perform the object manipulation task including reaching, grasping, and moving an object in sequence. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a humanoid robot with independent joint controller at each motor; its performance is demonstrated by manipulating an object with both arms.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been significant progress in robotics development, including the creation of humanoid robots. However, when it comes to the motion of the robot's working arm, it is crucial to achieve what is commonly referred to as human-like movement. Failure to achieve this can lead to feelings of fear or discomfort when observing the robot. In order to address this issue, research has been conducted on generating human-like movement by applying machine learning based on human motion. Furthermore, a multi-class classification model is identified using a system identification method called Element Description Method (EDM) to select the most human-like motion from multiple motion plans obtained through inverse kinematics. To improve the accuracy of EDM, actual human joint angles are used as training data, along with questionnaire results on movements considered to be human-like when performed in positions beyond the reach of humans. The generated learning model is then validated for its accuracy, and finally, a comparison is made to evaluate the differences with conventional machine learning methods.},

In order to help anthropomorphic arms produce precise human-like motions, this research introduces a unique planning method for human-like movements. Movement primitives, a Bayesian network (BN), and a new Long Short Term Memory network make up the three elements of the approach (LSTM). Human arm movements are broken down using movement primitives, and classifying arm motions improves the realism of human-like motions. The probability that a movement will occur is predicted using a motion-decision algorithm based on Bayesian Netwrok, which also chooses the best mode of motion. A brand new LSTM is also created to address the inverse kinematics issues with anthropomorphic arms. Several models are combined into a single network using the LSTM, which modifies the network’s structure to reflect the properties of the individual models. The suggested method enables anthropomorphic arms to accurately produce a variety of human-like actions. Lastly, simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of the suggested technique.},

  abstract={During the communication and interaction with a human using motions or gestures, a humanoid robot needs to not only look like a human but also behavior like a human to avoid confusions in the communication and interaction. Among human-like behaviors, arm motions of the humanoid robot are essential for the communication with people through motions. In this work, a mathematical representation for characterizing human arm motions is first proposed. The human arm motions are characterized by the elbow elevation angle that is determined using the position and orientation of human hands. That representation is mathematically obtained using an approximation tool, response surface method (RSM). Then, a method to generate human-like arm motions in real time using the proposed representation is presented. The proposed method was evaluated to generate human-like arm motions when the humanoid robot was asked to move its arms from a point to another point including the rotation of hand.

  abstract={Natural and human-like arm motions are promising features to facilitate social understanding of humanoid robots. To this end, we integrate biophysical characteristics of human arm-motions into sampling-based motion planning. We show the generality of our method by evaluating it with multiple manipulators. Our first contribution is to introduce a set of cost functions to optimize for human-like arm postures during collision-free motion planning. In a subsequent step, an optimization phase is used to improve the human-likeness of the initial path. Additionally, we present an interpolation approach for generating obstacle-aware and multi-modal velocity profiles. We thus generate collision-free and human-like motions in narrow passages while allowing for natural acceleration in free space.},

  abstract={With the paradigm shift from hospital-centric healthcare to home-centric healthcare in Healthcare 4.0, healthcare robotics has become one of the fastest growing fields of robotics. The combination of robot capabilities with human intelligence, for example, telerobotics for home care, is gradually showing promising potentials. In this paper, the Home-TeleBot system, a generalized IoT-enabled telerobotic architecture designed to support home-centric healthcare system, is proposed. In particular, the implementation of it is realized by integrating human-motion-capture subsystem with robot-control subsystem. The dual-arm cooperative robot, YuMi, imitates human motion captured by a set of wearable inertial motion capture devices to complete tasks. The proposed approach using workspace mapping and path planning of robot manipulators, facilitates telerobot to execute tasks in a natural and human-like way. Based on the constant of proportionality calculated by comparing the human original workspace with the robot original workspace, the workspace mapping is achieved by making assumptions of the distance between end-effectors (human hands, robot's grippers) and shoulders. Additionally, robot manipulators’ path is planned by setting virtual obstacles to constrain robot motion, which aims to improve the performance of robot's human-like motion. As a specific example of application, we apply the proposed architecture to a fetching task based on dual-arm motion capture and mapping for telerobotics in home care.},

The C_FMT∗ reduces the constrained planning problem to the unconstrained instance by sampling in the obstacle-free Cartesian space and satisfying the task constraints; it can solve most of these constrained path planning tasks quickly and obtain lower cost solutions compared to the existing techniques. In addition, a validity checking method of Cartesian sampling points based on self-motion manifolds is introduced to ensure the probabilistic completeness of the new planner. By analyzing musculoskeletal models of the human arm and the muscle strength property, a torque effort criterion was deduced to generate biomimetic motion for anthropomorphic arms. Then, an H_FMT∗ that incorporates the FMT∗ algorithm with the torque effort criterion is also proposed and used to bias the tree growth toward human-like movements in the self-motion manifolds of the obtained path. Finally, the proposed approach has been illustrated with several real examples executed with a humanoid robot. The obtained results show that the paths obtained with the proposed approach are quicker and more human-like.},

  abstract={Autonomic mobile base (MB)'s location & upper-body's configuration design and control are two of the fundamental issues to realize robotic autonomy. Besides, the human-like behaviors capacity is essential for human-robot interaction scenarios. Thus, to achieve human-like autonomy, this paper proposes a motion planning and tracking strategy for a redundant dual-arm humanoid mobile manipulator system. Specifically, the inverse dynamic reachability map (iDRM), the improved MaxiMin NSGA-II and the direct-connect bidirectional RRT & gradient descent algorithms are employed. Firstly, iRM is constructed and used to design potential MB's location area. Then, the improved MaxiMin NSGA-II algorithm is used to determine the desired end-pose based on the selected MB's location area. After the desired end-pose is designed, the direct-connect bidirectional RRT & gradient descent algorithm will be used to generate the approaching trajectory from the initial pose to the desired end-pose. Finally, the RBFNN controller is used to track the planned trajectory. On the other hand, if there are new obstacles, iDRM will be obtained by updating iRM. iRM and iDRM accelerate the desired end-pose design by narrowing MB's searching area. Moreover, to achieve human-like motions five criteria including the end-effectors' (EE) displacement with respect to MB are proposed. Several motion planning simulations are realized that validate the proposed strategy.},

  abstract={Generating human-like robot motions is pivotal for achieving smooth human-robot interactions. Such motions contribute to better predictions of robot motions by humans, thus leading to more intuitive interaction and increased acceptability. Human likeness in robot motions has been conventionally measured and realized via the optimization of human-likeness metrics. However, the abundance of such metrics and the absence of standardized criteria impede their usage in novel contexts. In this work, we introduce a unified human-likeness metric built from a hierarchically weighted sum of individual metrics. The proposed metric is derived from a thorough analysis of eleven existing human-likeness criteria and is applicable across various tasks and robot models. We evaluate its performance in the context of motion retargeting of bimanual tasks with three different humanoid robots.},

  abstract={Safety in industrial robotic environments is a hot research topic in the area of human-robot interaction (HRI). Up to now, a robotic arm on an assembly line interacts with other machines away from human workers. Nowadays, robotic arm manufactures are aimed to their robots could increasingly perform tasks collaborating with humans. One of the ways to improve this collaboration is by making the movement of robots more humanlike. This way, it would be easier for a human to foresee the movement of the robot and approach it without fear of contact. The main difference between the movement of a human and of a robotic arm is that the former has a bell-shaped speed profile while the latter has a uniform speed one. To generate this speed profile, the kinematic theory of rapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model has been used. This model is widely used to explain most of the basic phenomena related to the control of human movements. Both human-like and robotic-like movements are transferred to the UR3 robot. In this paper we detail the how the UR3 robot was programmed to produce both kinds of movement. The dissimilarities result between the input motion and output motion to the robot confirm the possibility to develop human-like velocities in the UR3 robot.},

  abstract={The manipulator must have a humanoid structure and human-like motion to achieve close and effective collaboration with humans. The anthropo-morphic manipulator has a structure similar to a human arm. We propose a human-like motion plan-ning method for moving target scenarios. We use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to model the anthropomorphic manipulator's end-effector motion. Compared to the conventional DMPs formalism, the proposed method contains the following extensions:1) an orientation-based spatial scaling,2) online temporal scaling parameter adaptation with moving targets feed-back. And we use a deep residual convolution neural network (ResCNN) to model the elbow motion of the anthropomorphic manipulator. Based on these models, real-time trajectory planning is performed for the moving target. In real-time motion planning, there is no need to model the moving target; only the moving tar-get's current position and velocity information is used to obtain a human-like motion of the anthropomorphic manipulator regarding posture and velocity. Simulation experiments on the Kinova Jaco2 in Coppeliasim show that our approach is practical.},

Humanoid movement is then generated by selecting the linear combination of basis elements that yields the highest probability for the trained HMM, subject to user-specified movement boundary conditions.

Human-like goal configurations are found using a criterion from ergonomics research. The knowledge which pose of the Tool Center Point (TCP) can be reached in a natural manner is encapsulated in a restricted reachability map for the robot arm.},

  abstract={Given the significant potential for robot-assisted rehabilitation, developing well-planned trajectories plays a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of such rehabilitation methods. A critical aspect of this field, particularly concerning the movement of the human upper limb, is the redundancy resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel trajectory planning method aimed at addressing the redundancy resolution in reaching motions related to Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This method is inspired by prior studies on maximum manipulability while emphasizing the natural upper limb posture, particularly the human preference for maintaining a nearly steady elbow position during ADL movements unless, of course, the range of the desired motion requires otherwise. A trajectory-combining approach is developed for generating trajectories in the human configuration space. Additionally, we present a configuration transformation model for human-robot configuration alignment. Experimental results validate the hypothesis of a steady elbow position and combine features from the Minimum Jerk (MJ) and Minimum Angular Jerk (MAJ) methods, demonstrating more natural reaching motions. The configuration transformation model has been successfully tested on the TAMU CLEVERarm, a lightweight and compact upper limb exoskeleton.},

One of the novel features of our approach is that each movement primitive is represented and stored as a set of joint trajectory basis functions; these basis functions are extracted via a principal component analysis of human motion capture data. By representing arbitrary movements as a linear combination of these basis functions, and by taking advantage of recently developed geometric optimization algorithms for multibody systems, dynamics-based optimization can be more efficiently performed.

  abstract={A new approach for solving an optimal control problem of ball pitching with an underactuated human-like robot arm is proposed. The system dynamics is simplified to a planar two-link robot with actuation only at the shoulder joint and a passive spring at the elbow joint representing the stiffness of the arm. The objective is to accelerate the ball from an initial configuration at rest in such a way that the projection of its velocity along a certain elevation angle is maximal at a predefined release line. The suggested procedure makes use of a parameterization of the robot motion in terms of geometric relations among the generalized coordinates. We systematically formulate a necessary condition for an optimal motion resulting in a nonlinear differential equation that describes a synchronization of the joint angles. A suitable solution is found by numerically searching over a finite number of free initial conditions.},

  abstract={Movement generation in robotics is an old problem with many excellent solutions. Most of them, however, look for optimality according to some metrics, but have no biological inspiration or cannot be used to imitate biological motion. For a human these techniques behave in a non-naturalistic way. This poses a problem for instance in human-robot interaction and, in general, for a good acceptance of robots in society. The present work presents a new analysis of the attractor dynamics approach to movement generation used in an anthropomorphic robot arm. Our analysis points to the possibility of using this approach to generate human-like arm trajectories in robots. One key property of human trajectories in pick-and-place tasks is the planarity of the trajectory of the end effector in 3D space. We show that this feature is also displayed by the attractor dynamic approach and, therefore, is a good candidate to the generation of naturalistic arm movements.},

  abstract={The need for users' safety and technology accept-ability has incredibly increased with the deployment of co-bots physically interacting with humans in industrial settings, and for people assistance. A well-studied approach to meet these requirements is to ensure human-like robot motions. Classic solutions for anthropomorphic movement generation usually rely on optimization procedures, which build upon hypotheses devised from neuroscientific literature, or capitalize on learning methods. However, these approaches come with limitations, e.g. limited motion variability or the need for high dimensional datasets. In this work, we present a technique to directly embed human upper limb principal motion modes computed through functional analysis in the robot trajectory optimization. We report on the implementation with manipulators with redundant anthropomorphic kinematic architectures - although dissimilar with respect to the human model used for functional mode extraction - via Cartesian impedance control. In our experiments, we show how human trajectories mapped onto a robotic manipulator still exhibit the main characteristics of human-likeness, e.g. low jerk values. We discuss the results with respect to the state of the art, and their implications for advanced human-robot interaction in industrial co-botics and for human assistance.},

  abstract={A framework to generate a human-like arm motion of a humanoid robot using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA)-based imitation learning is proposed. The framework consists of two processes, imitation learning of human arm motions and real-time generating of a human-like arm motion using the motion database evolved in the learning process. The imitation learning builds the database for the humanoid robot that is initially converted from human motion capture data and then evolved using a genetic operator based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in an evolutionary algorithm. This evolution process also considers the minimizing of joint torques in the robot. The database is then used to generate humanoid robot's arm motions in real-time, which look like human's and require minimal torques. The framework is examined for humanoid robot to reach its arms for catching a ball. Additionally, the inverse kinematics problem to determine the final posture of 6-DOF robot arm with a waist for the task of catching a ball, is proposed.},

These synergies are used to both obtain human-like movements and to reduce the complexity of the planning phase by reducing the dimension of the search space. In addition, the paper proposes a sampling-based planner, which guides the motion planning following the synergies and considering different types of grasps.

  abstract={At present, industrial robot arms have been widely applied in actual production. Especially for some human-robot cooperation work scenarios, involving the interaction between human and robot in sharing workspace, the requirement of trajectory planning for safety and natural interaction was more demanded. Aiming to solve the problems of the complex planning of trajectory and low security of man-machine cooperation, this paper introduced a control method of human-like trajectory based on the k-nearest neighbors. By using the Kinect equipment, the trajectories of wrist joint of human arm were acquired during manipulation tasks and then the k-nearest neighbors algorithm was adopted to analyze the trajectories. Consequently, the control laws of human-like trajectory of robot end-effecter are extracted based on the collected motion data. The corresponding experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method and this method can generate the human-like trajectory for robot manipulators, avoiding the collision with human arm and obstacles. It also enhances the performance of security and makes robots more human-robot friendly.},

  abstract={This paper presents a state-of-art reinforcement learning strategy to enable a human-like dual arm mobile robot to deal with some complicated tasks with dual arm cooperation. A complex movement task of robot can be divided into action phases and subgoals, each of which corresponds to a dynamic motion primitive (DMP). During control of the humanoid-like dual arm mobile robot, there are some noises that affect the precision of the movement of the robot. To deal with those uncertain perturbations while handling varying manipulation dynamics for grasping motion, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with sequences of dynamical motion primitives strategy is proposed in this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a two-phase planning has been considered in the experiment, namely, the online redundancy resolution based on the neural-dynamic optimization algorithm to obtain the initial joint trajectories on the first trial, and the reinforcement learning of DMP in the learning process, where DMP is used to model the joint trajectories, and then reinforcement learning is employed to adjust the model to suppress uncertain perturbations.},

  abstract={When a mobile robot performs some special tasks, such as carrying a heavy load, moving on a slope or rough terrain, particularly contacting with the environment, it may become unstable even overturn. First, the paper presents a mobile humanoid robot whose upper human-like body is mounted on the mobile platform supported by three wheels (two driving wheels and one caster wheel) and subjected to nonholonomic kinematic constraints. Then the kinematics of the mobile platform and the upper human-like body are studied and tip-over stability of the motion on a slope is analyzed. Following that, two cases are studied with different postures of the upper body and two arms in accordance with the motion on a slope. Computer simulations are carried out and the influences of different robotic postures on the tip-over stability are analyzed through simulation results.},

  abstract={The unique ability of humanoid robots to step over or upon obstacles is left unexploited if ordinary mobile robot navigation strategies are used for humanoids as well. Recently presented path planning strategies that make use of this capability, however, are very time consuming due to high computational complexity. We have presented a novel approach to humanoid robot footstep planning in obstacle cluttered environments that employs a human-like approach to terrain traversal. This paper mainly centers on providing a proof of concept for the algorithm while also bringing about some improvements. Unlike previous statically stable simulation work, here we present footstep plans including dynamic walk together with practical results of HRP-2 humanoid robot navigating in various scenarios with different obstacle characteristics. These also include catering for body sway dynamics as well as planning and executing stepping over obstacles encountered at angles not perpendicular to the robot's line of motion.},

  abstract={In this paper an evolutionary-based pattern generator to draw lines, curves, and shapes using a robotic arm without explicit instructions, is presented. Drawing is considered to be denoting a symbol with continuous curves and lines, which is different from the work of a printer. First, we consider drawing the digits 0 to 9 in the simulation environment with a robotic arm. Next, the ability of the method to learn drawing more complicated patterns is studied. The method is applied to control the irb4600 robotic arm for drawing patterns, in the Webots simulation environment. Our proposed method is compared with some other relevant methods the advantages and disadvantages of each approach were examined. The advantage of our algorithm is that it allows us to draw the desired shapes by the robot without prior training and the need for large amounts of data. The results of this paper can greatly benefit the applications in the industry of autonomous cutting, welding, drawing, and industrial design. We were able to successfully draw various types of shapes and symbols in the simulation and generate an accurate (more than 94% across distinct runs) trajectory for our robot.},

In addition, it delivers non-verbal, non-display communicative cues through human-like head motions while it is plugged into docking mounts with different states, including angled or moving.

  abstract={This paper reports a failed attempt to predict deviations of human arm movements from task elicited by perception of simultaneous robot arm movements (motor interference) using subjective ratings of anthropomorphism. This motor interference effect is known to result from unconscious imitation of movements of a human-like counterpart due to mirror-neuron activation. A study is conducted, with test participants and a robot conducting vertical and horizontal arm movements in front of each other in all combinations, and additionally with and without a robot head being present, in a between-subjects design. Perceived anthropomorphism is acquired using the evaluated tests HRIES and Godspeed. A correlation analysis on the dependency of motor interference on anthropomorphism did not reveal significant results of the constructs targeting human-like appearance, intelligence or movement behavior, which were expected to represent relevant predictor parameters. Further, scatter plots do not show a clear pattern. Only the likability Godspeed sub-scale is significant, which however may not be related to the targeted effect. Additionally, the ‘consciousness’ item within the ‘anthropomorphism sub-scale of Godspeed is significant, however, with unclear effect. So, no evidence could be found, that subjective assessments of anthropomorphism with existing tests may be suitable for prediction of motor interference and further research is required.},

In this paper, we designed a dual-arm robot-HR2 as experimental platform to verify the proposed method, select the joint angles and arm angles as the evaluation values, to compare our method with Track-IK and ikfast methods. The comparison results show that our method can keep the consistent of motion better.},

  abstract={Research on T-FloW humanoid robot in EEPIS Robotics Research Center (ER2C) has entered the third generation. Previously, the robot already had primitive motions to mimic 'human-like' walking capabilities by making use of an open loop motion controller. Yet, a feedback control system is required in order to take corrective measures due to walking parameter variations. In this current stage of the work, the development is aimed to provide the robot with adequate number of sensors to detect the movement of the robot. This paper describes the utilisation of the sensors in our robot to analyze and detect its condition when the robot begins to fall down. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor consists of 3-axes accelerometer and 3-axes gyrometer was in use. The analysis was done under V-REP simulation software which is equipped with Vortex dynamic engine. The simulation showed the detected characteristic of the walking parameters of the robot just before it begins to fall down. This simulation result is paramount for further T-FloW walking controller development.},

  abstract={Greeting interaction with physical contacts, such as the handshake motions of robots has been discussed in previous papers. In these papers, researchers have discussed the robot's response to human's handshake request in with and without voice greeting environments. Based on a study result, during handshake greeting between human and robot, starting the voice greeting before the hand motion shows favorable feedback from humans [1]. On the other hand, greeting interaction without physical contact, such as the hand-up motions of robots has not been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, a hand-up response motion model was proposed for generation of hand-up greeting with human in with and without voice greeting environments. Initially, mutual hand-up greetings between human in with and without voice greeting environments are analyzed. Based on the differences in motion characteristics of humans during mutual hand-up greeting in both environments, a hand-up response motion model in which a robot responds to human's request for a hand-up greeting is proposed. Using the developed hand-up robot motion system, the effectiveness of the motion model is demonstrated through sensory evaluation experiments. Subsequently, the differences of the motion characteristics of the robot's response to hand-up greeting interactions in the case of hand-up greeting with voice greeting and without voice greeting preferred by humans are discussed.},

To handshake with a person, we use inverse kinematics (IK) of Sophia-Hubo's right arm for stretching the arm to the person and torque control for handshaking. We use Levenberg-Marquardt method with Robust Damping to find a solution of the IK, and torque control of Dynamixel on shoulder pitch and elbow joint. The torque control input is calculated with the measured joint angular velocity. For making joints moving smoothly, we apply a 5th polynomial function trajectory. Through recursively adding the 5th polynomial trajectory to the end of the previous trajectory, we can make gestures.},

  abstract={Traditionally, potential fields and vector fields have been extensively used for motion planning, especially in finding paths to a goal position while avoiding obstacles along the way. However, such methods have only been applied to the problem of finding the shortest path to only one goal position. In human-centered environments with multiple goals, the shortest path (e.g., most predictable) is often not the most intent-expressive path (e.g., most legible) to one of the goals. We devised a method for robot planning and navigation in human-centered environments that uses potential fields to plan intent-expressive motion to a specific goal among many, while utilizing adaptive vector fields to avoid obstacles without sacrificing the legibility property of the motion. We found that our method can produce motions that are of comparable legibility and shorter path length compared to a legible motion planner baseline, as well as more legible paths compared to a traditional potential field method. Our method was evaluated in several scenarios where legibility is useful, namely maps with and without obstacles and goal switching.},

  abstract={Co-robots, i.e. robots that work close to people, will need to account for the preferences and expectations of their human co-workers in executing trajectories or actions. Consistent, legible and predictable trajectories are a key factor in making humans comfortable around robots. In this work, we take a data-driven approach towards designing robot trajectories that are more acceptable to human co-workers and observers. We use an online survey to ask people to rate multiple robot trajectories generated in a variety of environments. We compute a large set of features for each trajectory, also taking into account environment information. We use a combination of the features and the survey ratings to learn a classifier that predicts the rating for a new trajectory based on the learned human-observer preferences. The classifier also helps identify and highlight the most important features that influence people's ratings of the trajectories. Finally, we discuss how a data-driven approach using the results of this analysis can be used to help design better trajectories that are more acceptable to people.},

  abstract={In human-robot collaboration, legible intent of the robot is critical to success as it enables the human to more effectively work with and around the robot. Environments where humans and robots collaborate are widely varied and in the real world are most often cluttered. However, prior work in legible motion utilizes primarily environments which are uncluttered. Success in these environments does not necessarily guarantee success in more cluttered environments. Furthermore, the prior work has been primarily performed based on results from robot-human studies and the problem has not been studied from the prospective of what people do to express intent to each other. Therefore, this work addresses a gap in current research into legible robot arm motion in the following ways: first we perform a human-human study in order to establish the factors which humans use to express their intent through body language, and second we perform the study in a cluttered and varied environment. Through the study we showed that the primary factors which people considered are: timing, kinematic parameters, hand gestures, object proximity, etc. The results also showed that legibility is correlated with perceived safety, perceived social intelligence, the collaborator’s contribution, and trust which further speaks to the importance of legible motion. Future work will utilize the pose data extracted from the study’s video recordings to develop a model for legible motion.},

  abstract={This paper solved the motion planning problem for dual-arm robots, so that the robots can move more “human-like”. In this study, firstly an Auto-Encoder (AE) method is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the search space in the encoding process to obtain the hidden space. Then, RRT-connect in the low-dimensional space is employed to get the planning path according to the start and goal of the given task. Finally, the dual-arm robots can perform the human-like movement after mapping the samples from the low-dimensional space to the original search space. Taking advantage of the proposed method, the low-dimensional space has non-linear representation of the original space while reducing the dimensionality. Experiments are conducted by imitating pouring water using dual-arm robots. The results show that the computational load and memory are reduced significantly and movements are more human-like compared with the existing method.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={In robot motion planning, providing multiple diverse trajectories to guide a robot to reach a given goal is important for the resilience of the robot to environmental changes. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promising results in enabling the agents to learn diverse trajectories in motion planning. The majority of such works employed a two-part reward system, consisting of a goal-reaching reward and a diversity reward. For the former, distance rewards are normally adopted for their rich signals to guide the agents closer to the goal. The problem is that distance rewards change constantly as the agents progress towards the goal and, when combined with the diversity rewards, may interfere with the latter, causing poor learning results. In this paper, we propose to use binary rewards as the goal-reaching rewards. Binary rewards are static and predictable, allowing the diversity rewards to remain stable. The problem of sparsity of binary rewards is resolved with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER). Experimental results show that the proposed method enables the agents to learn efficient goal-reaching policies that are more diverse and robust to resist environmental changes compared to the prior approaches.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel method for controlling a dual arm robot to pick heavy objects. The motivation for this study is inspired from the observation of human motion in their daily activities. Two reflex actions are proposed in this work. The first reflex is designed to control the COM of the robot when its stability is endangered by the effect of the object weight. Static stability criterion is used to observe this dangerous effect and a simple minimization technique is used to generate the reflex torque. The second reflex aims to reduce the consumed torque of the motors by simply finding a pose at which the gravity term minimized. A control law is suggested for a dual arm robot to perform picking motion for both two cases with known and unknown objects. The control state space is the operational space and no inverse kinematics are needed. Finally, several dynamic simulations are introduced to validate the efficiency of the proposed controller.},

We developed a musculoskeletal model to estimate muscle force, which shows the load of human body. A stiffness sensor was also developed to measure the softness distribution of human body. Contact human body on soft place can make people feel less pain. In simulation, we estimate human posture and comfortable robot motion by minimizing muscle force and contacting human body on the softest places. In experiments, the measured subjects' postures were compared with the estimated value using the estimated motions. Measured postures were very close to simulation, which shows the effectiveness of proposed method.},

  abstract={In our research center, we have developed a nursing-care assistant robot - RIBA. This robot can lift up and transfer patient between bed and wheelchair using two human like arms. In this research, we proposed a new method to generate comfortable lifting-up motion automatically for using this robot. This method can reduce the pain feeling of patient during lift-up by setting robot arms to contact human body on the softest places. In order to measure the stiffness of soft human body, a stiffness sensor was developed, which has a large measurement range. We measured the stiffness on the back of upper body and thighs. From the measured data, we got an average stiffness distribution. In simulation, by controlling robot arm to lift human body up from the estimated softest place and minimizing the load of human body, we obtained a most comfortable robot motion. In experiment, all subjects felt this motion comfortable. The measured subjects' postures were also very close to the estimated value, which confirmed the effectiveness of stiffness measurement and motion generation method.},

  abstract={Humanoid robots have - by definition - some level of human-likeness in body form. According to previous research in HRI, this leads to a higher expectation of human-like behavior. Nevertheless, human-likeness is not an easy notion to define for motion even in a task as straight forward as real-time motion copying (the shadowing task) as this paper will try to argue. The main hypothesis of this paper is that subjective evaluation of robot's motion's human-likeness depends not only on the objective similarity between robot's motion and human motion but also on the interaction context (e.g, whether or not the human have previously engaged in mutual or back imitation with the robot). Moreover, the paper proposes two features of motion similarity that affect subjective evaluation of human-likeness and accuracy in the shadowing task and shows that human-likeness is a different attribution dimension form both accuracy and humanness (measured using human-nature traits). The paper reports a controlled user study involving 36 participants and 108 HRI sessions to support these claims.},

We aim at constructing the optimized database structure which have the minimum number of one.

  abstract={This presentation proposes a numerical framework that optimizes the throwing motions and generates the associated dynamic features for a whole-body humanoid. Rigorous dynamic models, such as actuation, biped balance based on Zero-Moment Point (ZMP), and ground reaction loads, are associated with the constraints. The algorithm outputs include the motion, required actuator torques, release parameters, and object projectile. Realistic human-like motions of sidearm and maximum distance throwing are generated as optimized solutions. The sidearm throw shows better optimality than the overarm throw in terms of actuator torques under the proposed mechanical model. The maximum distance throw is associated with active movement of the arm and torso with larger ranges of motion.},

  abstract={The degree of automation in the area of analytical measurements is still low-in contrast to well-automated bioscreening and high-throughput screening applications. Typical analytical measurement processes are very complex and involve transportation, sample preparation including direct manipulation and operation of laboratory devices as well as measurement and data evaluation. A wide variety of vessels and containers is used for chemicals and samples; the processes are often changing and have to be modified frequently. The demand for flexible and adaptable automation solutions is high. Flexibility includes the use of multiple instruments-conventional manual instruments and automation equipment-and an easy system change to a wide variety of applications. Dual-arm robotic systems captivate by their human like structure and the possibility to perform processes in the same way as human laboratory assistants. Especially in highly regulated areas, this property may be a big advantage since existing manual standard procedures can still be used. A dual-arm robotic system is presented for fully automated sample preparation and measurement. A new concept for robot motion planning and process generation is introduced to increase the system performance-processing times and flexibility. The motion planning approaches were practically compared by performing a sample preparation process with subsequent determination of the enantiomeric excess of amino acids. The results show a reduction of the processing time of 30.3% with measurement results close to the manual procedure.},

  abstract={This paper presents a component-based framework of humanoid robot task coordination using Predicate Transition Nets (PrT Nets). Humanoid robots have a large number of degrees of freedom (DOF) and they are expected to generate human-like stable behaviors to finish missions. Their motions have to satisfy a set of constraints (balance, coordinated motions, collision free movements), which increases the complexity of the system - each movement may consist of several types of movements and tasks simultaneously. Task is defined as a sequence of movements and/or actions towards to completing a given mission. It is key to represent the task coordination precisely and correctly to program on humanoid robots' motions. To solve the challenge issue of multiple task coordination for a humanoid robot, we presented a framework that integrates Component Based Software Development (CBSD) with Predicate Transition Nets to analyze the correctness of task co ordinations. Each component's behavior can be represented by a Predicate Transition Net, and the constraints of the behaviors are described by a set of temporal logic formulae. To ensure the task co ordinations are met, a rewriting logic-based model checker is applied to verify the system against the constraints. This formal framework is general and can be used for other type humanoid robots. It allows the representation of motion plans and provides the flexibility of semantic analysis on the humanoid robotics systems.},

  abstract={The development of a humanoid robot within the scope of the collaborative research centre 588 - “Humanoid Robots - Learning and Cooperating Multimodal Robots” - has the objective of creating a machine that can closely cooperate and interact with humans. For designer this development area presents new challenges in mechanic design. Compared to industrial robots - for which high velocities, mechanical rigidity, and precision (also repeat accuracy) are primary requirements - the key aspects here are humanlike motions, a motion space that corresponds to that of human beings and the prevention of hazards to users. In order to meet these requirements, the robot must have a humanlike appearance, motion space, and dexterity which automatically results in the requirement of a lightweight design. Additionally, its kinematics should be familiar to the user, and its motions predictable, so as to encourage inexperienced persons to interact with the machine. This article delivers insight into the design and especially the actuators of a new wrist for the next generation of the humanoid robot ARMAR. The goals of the development project are both to improve the motion space and to achieve a humanlike appearance. The new mechanical design is described in detail.},

  abstract={Learning by observation is a useful goal for humanoid robots that strive for human-like motion. Over time the movements and actions of these robots are likely to require modification for different scenarios and environments. Therefore being able to `teach' the robot new tasks and motions without tedious programming is highly useful. The operational space formulation is a highly elegant robot manipulator control method that has parallels with human motion strategies, with prioritization of task achievement and redundant degrees of freedom control via effort optimisation. In this paper, we combine a novel method of learning by observation with the operational space framework. This has created a learning controller that is able to generalise a small set of example reaching motions in order to reach to new targets while maintaining human like motion trajectories in the posture space via a novel sliding mode optimal controller. The trajectories are executed on a (dynamically) simulated robot arm which performs human like reaching to arbitrary locations. Trajectories are minimally encoded as the coefficients of fitted polynomials and the learning is performed by three neural networks that learn and generalise. Initial results are presented for this early stage of research on this proposed framework.},

  title={Goal Set Inverse Optimal Control and Iterative Replanning for Predicting Human Reaching Motions in Shared Workspaces}, 
  year={2016},
  volume={32},
  number={4},
  pages={897-908},
  abstract={To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces, it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function that “explains” the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example trajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative assembly task using motion capture. We then use inverse optimal control to learn a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict reaching motions from the human's current configuration to a task-space goal region by iteratively replanning a trajectory using the learned cost function. Our planning algorithm is based on the trajectory optimizer: stochastic trajectory optimizer for motion planning [1]; it plans for a 23-degree-of-freedom human kinematic model and accounts for the presence of a moving collaborator and obstacles in the environment. Our results suggest that in most cases, our method outperforms baseline methods when predicting motions. We also show that our method outperforms baselines for predicting human motion when a human and a robot share the workspace.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an effective walking pattern generator based on the five-mass with angular momentum model for humanoid robot. The proposed model is composed of conventional three-mass model and conservation law of angular momentum, which describes the relationship between two swing arms and legs, to achieve a quasi human-like walking. We further design a walking pattern compensator to revise the previous pattern that is not efficient for specific walking time period. Through increasing or reducing the responsibility of joints, the compensator works for sharing and distributing redundant time to other period that need more time. The results are confirmed by simulation and experiments on RENBO, the humanoid robot developed in our lab, respectively.},

  abstract={The Minimum Jerk motion model has long been cited in literature for human point-to-point reaching motions in single-person tasks. While it has been demonstrated that applying minimum-jerk-like trajectories to robot reaching motions in the joint action task of human-robot handovers allows a robot giver to be perceived as more careful, safe, and skilled, it has not been verified whether human reaching motions in handovers follow the Minimum Jerk model. To experimentally test and verify motion models for human reaches in handovers, we examined human reaching motions in unconstrained handovers (where the person is allowed to move their whole body) and fitted against 1) the Minimum Jerk model, 2) its variation, the Decoupled Minimum Jerk model, and 3) the recently proposed Elliptical (Conic) model. Results showed that Conic model fits unconstrained human handover reaching motions best. Furthermore, we discovered that unlike constrained, single-person reaching motions, which have been found to be elliptical, there is a split between elliptical and hyperbolic conic types. We expect our results will help guide generation of more humanlike reaching motions for human-robot handover tasks.},

  abstract={Much robotics research has focused on intent-expressive (legible) motion. However, algorithms that can autonomously generate legible motion have implicitly made the strong assumption of an omniscient observer, with access to the robot's configuration as it changes across time. In reality, human observers have a particular viewpoint, which biases the way they perceive the motion. In this work, we free robots from this assumption and introduce the notion of an observer with a specific point of view into legibility optimization. In doing so, we account for two factors: (1) depth uncertainty induced by a particular viewpoint, and (2) occlusions along the motion, during which (part of) the robot is hidden behind some object. We propose viewpoint and occlusion models that enable autonomous generation of viewpoint-based legible motions, and show through large-scale user studies that the produced motions are significantly more legible compared to those generated assuming an omniscient observer.},

First, we capture the human motions of maintaining balance and abstract essential mechanisms from these motions. Next, we construct a model of maintaining balance that has a simple structure, such as an inverted pendulum. This model has two modes of maintaining balance: keeping the feet on the ground, and stepping. In this paper, the stepping mode is mainly described. Finally, we generate whole-body motion based on the model against several perturbations, and we discuss the validity of our method},

  abstract={Rehabilitation robots play an increasingly important role in the recovery of motor function for stroke. To ensure a natural physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) and enhance the active participation of subjects, it is necessary for the robots to understand the human intention and cooperate actively with humanlike characteristics. This study proposed a hybrid active control algorithm with human motion intention detection. The motion intention was defined as the desired position and velocity, which were continuously estimated according to the human upper-limb model and minimum jerk model, respectively. The motion intention was then fed into a hybrid force and position controller of an upper-limb cable driven rehabilitation robot (CDRR). And a three-dimensional reaching task without predefined trajectory was employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm. Experimental results showed that the control algorithm could continuously recognize the human motion intention and enabled the robot better movement performance indicated as smaller offset error, smoother trajectory, and lower impact. The proposed method could guarantee a natural pHRI and improve the engagement of the subjects, which has great potential in clinical applications.},

Since the demonstrated synergies change depending on the robot position, a recursive Cartesian-space discretization is presented based on these differences. Thereby, different movements of the arms are assigned to different regions of the Cartesian space. As an application example, a motion-planning algorithm exploiting this information is proposed and used.},

  abstract={At the convergence of robotics and computer vision lies a crucial research field that focuses on the development of vision-guided walking for humanoid robots. The ability of humanoid robots to walk independently while simultaneously seeing and comprehending their surroundings via the use of visual inputs offers tremendous potential. Humanoid robots are developed to reproduce human-like qualities and skills. This abstract discusses current developments in the area of vision-guided walking for humanoid robots as well as the approaches that have been used. Through the use of computer vision methods in conjunction with walking algorithms, humanoid robots are given the capacity to traverse situations that are both complex and dynamic while exhibiting increased flexibility. For this, real-time sensing of the environment, object identification and avoidance of obstacles, as well as analysis of the terrain, are required in order to arrive at intelligent judgements while moving. Vision-guided walking not only makes robotic locomotion more secure and effective, but it also paves the way for a wide range of potential applications, including exploration, human-robot interaction, search and rescue, and many more. Visual sensing systems, sensor fusion procedures, gait generation methods, motion planning, and control strategies. These topics are discussed in relation to vision-guided walking. Different types of sensors, such as cameras, depth sensors, and LiDAR, are being investigated to see how they can best provide a holistic understanding of the surrounding environment. In addition, the abstract draws attention to the difficulties caused by sensor noise, occlusions, fluctuations in illumination, and the need for real-time processing. In places an emphasis on the role that methods of machine learning play in the improvement of vision-guided walking. The use of deep learning algorithms gives robots the ability to learn from data, hence enhancing their capacity to understand and react to their environment. The robot's total locomotion skills have been improved thanks to the use of reinforcement learning methodologies, which have been used to improve walking gaits and adapt to different types of terrain.},

  pages={4561-4568},
  abstract={In this work, we propose a method for trajectory implementation based on the Learning by Demonstrations approach to deal with trajectory planning issues in upper-limb rehabilitation exoskeletons. Currently applied path-planning methods use mathematical trajectories or Teach-and-play approaches. The former do not propose human-like movements to patients, which is crucial to induce correct motor relearning. Moreover, they often differ from therapists' expectations of how movements should be executed, reducing the acceptability and use of exoskeletons in hospitals. The latter, using a single filtered trajectory demonstration, better meet therapists' expectations but lack consistency and optimization. In our approach, we employed Hidden Markov Models, still never used for rehabilitation robotics, to study a set of demonstrations and we optimized the results to respect physiological muscular activation patterns. Recorded few repetitions of a movement from the interaction of a therapist with an exoskeleton, our machine-learning-based algorithm returns a ready-to-use trajectory representing the therapist's desires. We tested our method on a 4 degrees-of-freedom exoskeleton to record 5 exercises, interacting with 5 therapists. Comparing our trajectories with those obtained with literature methods, we see that our approach produces better kinematic and human-likeness results, and is better according to the global opinion expressed by the therapists.},

  abstract={In household settings, Learning from Demonstration techniques can enable end-users to teach their robots new skills. Furthermore, it may be necessary for the demonstrations to be accessible through a straightforward setup, such as a single visual sensor. This study presents a pipeline that uses a single RGB-D sensor to demonstrate movements taking into account all the key points of the human arm to control a non-anthropomorphic arm. To perform this procedure, we present the TAICHI algorithm (Tracking Algorithm for Imitation of Complex Human Inputs). This method includes detecting key points on the human arm and mapping them to the robot, applying Gaussian filtering to smooth movements and reduce sensor noise, and utilizing an optimization algorithm to find the nearest configuration to the human arm while avoiding collisions with the environment or the robot itself. The novelty of this method lies in its utilization of key points from the human arm, specifically the end-effector and elbow, to derive a similar configuration for a non-anthropomorphic arm. Through tests encompassing various movements performed at different speeds, we have validated the efficacy of our method and confirmed its efficiency in replicating the desired outcomes on the robot's end-effector and joints.},

  abstract={This paper proposes a novel method for anthropomorphic dual-arm robots to plan bimanual transport tasks, considering the feature of human-like structure and utilizing synergies to reduce the dimension of the system. Unlike conventional methods in which the trajectory of the transported object is explicitly prescribed in the operational space, the proposed method plans the motion upon intrinsic variables from both arms and produce the trajectory in an indirect way. Thus, the proposed method is a model-based “joint space” method and exploits the coordination of the arms in the motion planning procedure. The motion planning is divided into translation planning and orientation stabilization. Only the final positions of the wrist centers need to be specified for translation planning; the object's orientation will adapt following the translation. Simulation is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Comparison with the conventional method is performed to demonstrate the features of the proposed method.},

  abstract={In this paper the problem of planning trajectories using human-like vision information, and of solving inverse kinematics of robots by weighting joint involvement in a biomimetic fashion is considered. Movements of a redundant seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator, having a kinematic structure similar to that of the human arm, have been simulated. The design of the trajectory is based on theory about attentive vision in humans, and biomimetic considerations are used to infer laws to obtain human-like movements in inverse kinematics. The inverse kinematics is computed using a closed-loop algorithm with redundancy resolution where physically motivated secondary tasks are imposed to the internal motions, with the "virtual end-effectors" approach. Outputs of the IK algorithm related to drawing trajectories in the task space are compared with the positions of the joints of a human performing the same drawing task, computed from the images caught by a three-camera system},

  abstract={Nonverbal behavior during human-human close encounters is critical to the accomplishment of natural interaction. For this reason, humanoid robots trying to achieve natural interactions with humans should be able to understand and synthesis nonverbal behavior in a way that mimics the human use of it. One of the most important situations during natural human-robot interactions is the explanation scenario in which the human is explaining a task to the robot using natural verbal and nonverbal behavior. This situation occurs frequently in many HRI applications and is critical to the success of the robots as knowledge media project suggested by the authors. In this paper the implementation of a humanoid robot that can show human like gaze control during explanation settings based only on reactive processing is presented. The software of the robot is based on the EICA architecture designed to combine autonomy with interactivity in the lowest level of the system. The details of the implementation and analysis of the naturalness of behavior and the effect of noisy input is presented in this paper.},

  abstract={Human-like-motion performed by robots can have a contribution to exert a strong influence on human-robot interaction, because bodily expressions convey important and effective information. If the robots could adapt the features of human behavior to their motions and skills, the communication would become more smooth and natural. In this paper, we develop a posture measurement system for a robot imitation using a 3D image sensor. This paper proposes a method of robot posture generation based on a steady-state genetic algorithm (SSGA). SSGA is one of evolutionary optimization methods using selection, mutation, and crossover operators. Since SSGA is a simplified model, it is easy to implement into a real-time processing. Furthermore, we apply a continuous model of generation for an adaptive search in dynamical environment.},

  abstract={In this paper we propose and validate a teleoperated control approach for an anthropomorphic redundant robotic manipulator, using magneto-inertial sensors (IMUs). The proposed method allows mapping the motion of the human arm (used as the master) on the robot end-effector (the slave). We record arm movements using IMU sensors, and calculate human forward kinematics to be mapped on robot movements. In order to solve robot kinematic redundancy, we implemented different algorithms for inverse kinematics that allows imposing anthropomorphism criteria on robot movements. The main objective is to let the user to control the robotic platform in an easy and intuitive manner by providing the control input freely moving his/her own arm and exploiting redundancy and anthropomorphism criteria in order to achieve humanlike behaviour on the robot arm. Therefore, three inverse kinematics algorithms are implemented: Damped Least Squares (DLS), Elastic Potential (EP) and Augmented Jacobian (AJ). In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithms, four healthy subjects have been asked to control the motion of an anthropomorphic robot arm (i.e. the Kuka Light Weight Robot 4+) through four magneto-inertial sensors (i.e. Xsens Wireless Motion Tracking sensors - MTw) positioned on their arm. Anthropomorphism indices and position and orientation errors between the human hand pose and the robot end-effector pose were evaluated to assess the performance of our approach.},

  abstract={Following its applications on reception, space exploration, health care, and others, the dual-arm robot is employed for industrial automation more intensively these days. With a human-like two-arm structure of high degrees of freedom, it should be a strong competitor for industrial tasks of high complexity. However, up to date, its deployment is still far behind the traditional single-arm robot manipulator. It may be partially due to its higher price and larger installation space. Meanwhile, the lack of proper methods or devices to deal with task planning and teaching that usually involves robot motions of more than 10 DOF is also influential. Motivated by it, in this paper, we propose a novel manipulation system for the industrial dual-arm robot manipulator using virtual reality (VR). Especially, we propose taking advantage of the similarity between the dual-arm robot and human arm and come up with a human-like path planner, with an intention to incorporate that of human into robot path planning. In addition, we also furnish the system with several assistive tools, including that for physical behavior emulation and self-collision detection. Simulations based on realistic environments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed manipulation system, along with the questionnaires to evaluate user's responses.},

  abstract={As an example of human-like dynamic manipulation, robotic juggling using simple end effectors has been studied. The purpose of this research is to achieve juggling with a multifingered hand and arm like those of a human. One serious problem is that the weight of a multi-fingered hand and arm is large, and it is necessary to optimize the movement of the arm in order to compensate for the weight of the hand. In this paper, we propose a method of optimizing the motion trajectory using a smoothing spline. Parameters of the smoothing spline are optimized offline using a genetic algorithm. Another problem is to catch a falling ball accurately by the multifingered hand, and we use a high-speed vision system to estimate the trajectory of the ball. The task to be performed online by the robot hand and arm is to use the optimized parameters to throw a ball up into the air and catch the falling ball with high-speed visual feedback, repeatedly. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments in which the hand and arm realized throw-up and catch motions seven consecutive times.},

  abstract={Due to human sensitivity for humanlike objects, designing human-like behavior for a robot that interacts with humans remains a central issue in the HRI field. This issue is formidable because human-likeness is an important factor for better interaction since it can easily convey negative impressions if the design is not perfect, as in the uncanny valley phenomena. This paper addresses this issue with a novel approach that utilizes implicit know-how for performing on stage and is dedicated to represent human beings. Contemporary colloquial theatre theory (CCTT), which is a method of directing plays, is appropriate for this purpose since its reality-oriented instructions are directly applicable for improving robot behavior. In this paper, we report case studies on performing a play involving both humans and a robot. The play in our study was evaluated in public performances in Japan. We report detailed analysis of comparable short plays on human-robot interaction or human-human-robot interaction. Our analysis implies that utterance and motion timings should be tuned depending on the situation. Future work will use a motion capture system to get more precise data and more useful knowledge.},

  abstract={Efficient and collision-free coordination of two robot arms is increasingly needed in various service-oriented robotic applications. This paper proposes a dual-arm coordination algorithm to improve the efficiency of coordination by considering both robot's actions and operating sequences for tasks that require multiple operations with both arms. Teleoperation demonstration is performed to obtain the robot's human-like motion trajectories, so as to reduce the probability of collisions of the two robotic arms. The coordination diagram in time domain is designed to more clearly represent the situations of trajectory collisions and find the collision-free coordination action law. Simultaneously, a coordination pair generator (CPG) is designed to reorganize the operating sequences according to the characteristics of input trajectories in addition to the action coordination. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are verified on the experiment of the drug sorting task in nursing homes on the ABB YuMi robot model.},

  abstract={Humans, in comparison to robots, are remarkably adept at reaching for objects in cluttered environments. The best existing robot planners are based on random sampling of configuration space- which becomes excessively high-dimensional with large number of objects. Consequently, most planners often fail to efficiently find object manipulation plans in such environments. We addressed this problem by identifying high-level manipulation plans in humans, and transferring these skills to robot planners. We used virtual reality to capture human participants reaching for a target object on a tabletop cluttered with obstacles. From this, we devised a qualitative representation of the task space to abstract the decision making, irrespective of the number of obstacles. Based on this representation, human demonstrations were segmented and used to train decision classifiers. Using these classifiers, our planner produced a list of waypoints in task space. These waypoints provided a high-level plan, which could be transferred to an arbitrary robot model and used to initialise a local trajectory optimiser. We evaluated this approach through testing on unseen human VR data, a physics-based robot simulation, and a real robot (dataset and code are publicly available1). We found that the human-like planner outperformed a state-of-the-art standard trajectory optimisation algorithm, and was able to generate effective strategies for rapid planning- irrespective of the number of obstacles in the environment.},

The approach is first developed for rigid robot arms and then extended to the case of robots with elastic joints, proposing different reaction strategies.

  abstract={A manipulator with human-like movements enables better human-machine interaction and a more intuitive experience for the operator when he or she teleoperates it. In this work, we developed an interactive interface based on the robot operating system (ROS). An adaptive genetic algorithm was used to find the optimal robot arm configuration based on the positions of the elbow and wrist of the human arm inputted by the Kinect camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU). Validating the feasibility of the proposed method were the fixed pose experiment, the continuous wave experiment, and the pick-place experiment. Comparison of the proposed method to the conventional inverse kinematics algorithm and the general genetic algorithm shows that the wrist position error obtained by the three methods is smaller, and the elbow position obtained by the proposed method is closer to the target position. Based on the proposed method, the polygonal area enclosed by the configurations of the operator's arm and the manipulator is smaller, and the anthropomorphism is better.},

  abstract={Ensuring humanoid balance stability to prevent falling is one of the most crucial control problems in humanoid robotics and has been extensively studied in the past, resulting in a diverse range of balance recovery schemes. These balancing control methods effectively perform body posture control using three main motion strategies, namely: ankle, ankle-hip and stepping strategies. In this work we present a novel balance strategy which fundamentally differs from the previous methods as its principle is to exploit contacts with the environment to prevent falling rather than only performing body posture control. An uncoupled impedance controller for the upper body of the humanoid robot is combined with a lower body stabilizer, and the balancing capabilities are enhanced by the establishment of additional physical contacts with the environment. The generation of the reactive arm motion and the impedance regulation are discussed in details. Experimental trials with the humanoid robot COMAN, provided with active and passive compliance, demonstrate the potential of the approach and the first step towards the development of more human-like balancing skills using an integrated approach where all body parts (not only legs but also arms and hands) can establish contacts with the surrounding environment so as to ensure a stable and balanced behavior.},

  abstract={As humanoid robots start entering to the human beings environments, the collision between the robot and other objects is inevitable. To solve this problem, we propose the human mimicking push-recovery strategy. With the arm mechanism, the humanoid robot utilizes human-like strategies to deal with the unexpected collision. We analyse the human push-recovery movement to the external force. Thus we can design the trajectory generator to mimic human beings reactions. To reduce the modelling error and improve zmp stability, we utilizes the five-mass with angular momentum model as humanoid robot model. We design the safe bound examination and the Center of Mass (COM) state estimator to judge the collision stage. The safe bound examination is used to guarantee the walking stability. Moreover, the COM state estimator is used to determine whether the pushing is over or not. The push-recovery control system is implemented on the humanoid robot developed in our NTU-iCeiRA lab. The purpose of this paper aims to integrate different push-recovery strategies while encountering different collision conditions based on the five-mass with angular momentum model.},

  abstract={The method of human-like handwriting and drawing is addressed with a three-link arm. Three strategies of trajectory planning are considered: the basic stroke method, the Bezier curve method, and the non-gradient numerical optimization method. Planar patterns of handwriting or drawing are converted into the vector form of joint angles in which sequence and speed of the movement can be designed to imitate human handwriting and drawing. A nonlinear three-link three-dimensional arm, similar to a human arm, is developed to track the planned trajectories. The feasibility of these methods is demonstrated by simulation.},

  abstract={Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties engaging in imitation behavior. Available clinical tests that evaluate imitation rely on subjective observation and categorical “yes” or “no” data. We describe the development of a method to quantify imitation using a robot, kinematic data and a Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. A realistic-looking robot performed movements such as “waving hello/goodbye”, “good job fist bump” and encouraged children with ASD and controls to imitate it. Preliminary results show that children with ASD interact positively with the robot and the DTW similarity measure may serve as both a meaningful and objective tool for evaluating the quality of imitation behavior.},
