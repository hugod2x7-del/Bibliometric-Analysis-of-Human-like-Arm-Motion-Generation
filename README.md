  |--------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | E1     | Availability   | Full text of the papers not available in digital libraries                    |
  | E2     | Language       | Full text of the papers not published in English                              |
  | E3     | Year           | Papers not included in the year range of [2006‚Äì2024]                          |
  | E4     | Scope          | Papers that do not focus on humanoid robots or related motion planning/generation |
  | E5     | Topic Relevance| Papers that do not address arm/upper-limb motion, legibility, predictability, or human-like trajectories |
  | E6     | Source Type    | Papers not published in peer-reviewed journals or conference proceedings      |
