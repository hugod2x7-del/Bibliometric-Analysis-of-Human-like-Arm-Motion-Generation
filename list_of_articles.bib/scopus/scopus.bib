	abstract = {Human handwriting is an everyday task performed regularly by most people. In the domain of robotic painting, multiple calligraphy machines exist which were built to replicate some aspects of human artistic writing; however, most projects are limited to a specific style of handwriting, often Chinese calligraphy. We propose a two-stage pipeline that allows industrial robots to write text in arbitrary typefaces and scripts using paintbrushes. In the first stage, we extract a set of strokes from character glyphs which are similar to how humans choose strokes during writing. In the second stage, we generate corresponding brush trajectories by applying a brush model to the extracted strokes. Our brush model computes the required brush pressure to achieve the given stroke width while also accounting for brush lag. We also present a method to automatically measure the parameters needed to predict brush lag by painting and recording calibration patterns. Our method generates trajectories for text in any given typeface, which, when executed by a robotic arm, results in legible written text. We can render most writing systems, excluding emoji and ligatures, in which arbitrary texts can be specified to write. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this frame, different and sophisticated external stimuli to induce rotation have been developed. In this work, we have designed a simple and original self-propelled bimetallic Janus rotor powered by the synergy between a spontaneous electric and ionic current, produced by two coupled redox reactions, and a magnetic field, placed orthogonal to the surface of the device. Such a combination induces a magnetohydrodynamic vortex at each extremity of the rotor arm, which generates an overall driving force able to propel the rotor. Furthermore, the motion of the self-polarized object can be controlled by the direction of the spontaneous electric current or the orientation of the external magnetic field, resulting in a predictable clockwise or anticlockwise motion. In addition, these devices exhibit directional corkscrew-type displacement, when representing their displacement as a function of time, producing time-space specular behavior. The concept can be used to design alternative self-mixing systems for a variety of (micro)fluidic equipment. © 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society},

Knowledge of object properties and motion trajectory is required, but often not available in real-world manipulation tasks. Although it is possible to grasp and manipulate unknown objects, an uninformed grasp leads to inferior stability, accuracy, and repeatability of the manipulation. Therefore, a central challenge of in-hand manipulation in unstructured environments is to acquire this information safely and efficiently. We propose an in-hand manipulation framework that does not assume any prior information about the object and the motion, but instead extracts the object properties through a novel haptic exploration procedure and learns the motion from demonstration using dynamical movement primitives. We evaluate our approach by unknown object manipulation experiments using a human-like robot hand. The results show that haptic exploration improves the manipulation robustness and accuracy significantly, compared to the virtual spring framework baseline method that is widely used for grasping unknown objects.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Dual-arm robot manipulation is applicable to many domains, such as industrial, medical, and home service scenes. Learning from demonstrations is a highly effective paradigm for robotic learning, where a robot learns from human actions directly and can be used autonomously for new tasks, avoiding the complicated analytical calculation for motion programming. However, the learned skills are not easy to generalize to new cases where special constraints such as varying relative distance limitation of robotic end effectors for human-like cooperative manipulations exist. In this paper, we propose a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) based skills learning framework for redundant dual-arm robots. The method, with a coupling acceleration term to the DMPs function, is inspired by the transient performance control of Barrier Lyapunov Functions. The additional coupling acceleration term is calculated based on the constant joint distance and varying relative distance limitations of end effectors for object-approaching actions. In addition, we integrate the generated actions in joint space and the solution for a redundant dual-arm robot to complete a human-like manipulation. Simulations undertaken in Matlab and Gazebo environments certify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The task performed provides targets of end-effector position and orientation for the DMPs. We use a deep neural network (DNN) to provide the target of elbow elevation angle.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a motion, stiffness, and force learning framework based on an extended dynamic movement primitive (DMP) and quadratic programming (QP) optimization. The objective is to learn kinematic and dynamic operational parameters from a one-shot human demonstration, through measurement and estimation of the motion, 3-dimensional (3-D) endpoint stiffness, and applied forces of the human arm during manipulation tasks. To this end, first, the framework features an extended DMP to model the motion, stiffness, and force variations in Cartesian space and 2-D sphere manifold. Second, to account for collected errors and human-robot operation gaps, a QP optimization is applied to fine-tune the desired position of the controller. Finally, we validate the framework through two experiments in real scenarios on the Franka Emika Panda robot. Experimental results show that the robot can not only inherit the variation laws of motion, stiffness, and force in the human demonstration, but also exhibit certain generalization capabilities to other situations. The framework provides a reference for robots learning multiple skills via a one-shot human demonstration, which finds great potential application in human-robot cooperation, contact-rich scenarios, and skillful operations, where the motion, stiffness, and applied forces need to be considered simultaneously. Note to Practitioners - Fast programming in robotics through skill transfer plays a critical role in next-generation robots entering ordinary people's lives. Existing research focuses more on skill learning at the kinematic level and lacks on the dynamic level, such as stiffness and contact force. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel framework for robots learning of motion, stiffness, and force variations from a one-shot human demonstration, simultaneously. To this end, a Riemannian-based DMP method is employed to model the variation laws of motion, stiffness, and force in Cartesian space and 2-D sphere manifold, respectively. In this way, the learning module needs to be run only once, and the patterns can also be generalized to other targets without repeated robot teaching and additional time-consuming processes. To accurately reproduce the learned skills, a human-like motion/stiffness/force controller combined with QP optimization is investigated. In this paper, rather than identifying real environmental parameters, we directly use interacted forces during the human demonstration to represent environmental effects and employ QP to update the desired position in a limited range to account for collected errors and human-robot operation gaps. Experiments on button pressing and polishing tasks by the Panda robot have achieved very good results.

Moreover, they often differ from therapists' expectations of how movements should be executed, reducing the acceptability and use of exoskeletons in hospitals. The latter, using a single filtered trajectory demonstration, better meet therapists' expectations but lack consistency and optimization. In our approach, we employed Hidden Markov Models, still never used for rehabilitation robotics, to study a set of demonstrations and we optimized the results to respect physiological muscular activation patterns. Recorded few repetitions of a movement from the interaction of a therapist with an exoskeleton, our machine-learning-based algorithm returns a ready-to-use trajectory representing the therapist's desires. We tested our method on a 4 degrees-of-freedom exoskeleton to record 5 exercises, interacting with 5 therapists. Comparing our trajectories with those obtained with literature methods, we see that our approach produces better kinematic and human-likeness results, and is better according to the global opinion expressed by the therapists.  © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, the human-like behavior on the anthropomorphic robot manipulator is increasingly accomplished by the kinematic model establishing the relationship of an anthropomorphic manipulator and human arm motions. Notably, the growth and broad availability of advanced data science techniques facilitate the imitation learning process in anthropomorphic robotics. However, the enormous dataset causes the labeling and prediction burden. In this article, the swivel motion reconstruction approach was applied to imitate human-like behavior using the kinematic mapping in robot redundancy. For the sake of efficient computing, a novel incremental learning framework that combines an incremental learning approach with a deep convolutional neural network is proposed for fast and efficient learning. The algorithm exploits a novel approach to detect changes from human motion data streaming and then evolve its hierarchical representation of features. The incremental learning process can fine-tune the deep network only when model drifts detection mechanisms are triggered. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated this neural network's learning procedure and translated the trained human-like model to manage the redundancy optimization control of an anthropomorphic robot manipulator (LWR4+, KUKA, Germany). This approach can hold the anthropomorphic kinematic structure-based redundant robots. The experimental results showed that our architecture could not only enhance the regression accuracy but also significantly reduce the processing time of learning human motion data.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Owing to advancements in robotics, researchers have been focusing on integrating humanoid robots into actual environments. Most humanoid robots are equipped with seven-degree-of-freedom (DoF) arms that allow them to be flexible in different scenarios. The controller of a 7-DoF robotic arm must select one solution among the infinite sets of solutions for a given inverse kinematics problem. To date, no suitable approach has been developed for identifying appropriate human-like postures for a robotic arm with an offset wrist configuration. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that considers the movement of the human arm to consistently find a suitable human-like posture. First, a one-class support vector machine model is employed to classify human-like postures. Then, the algorithm uses the redundancy characteristic of a 7-DoF robotic arm with a linear regression model to enhance the search of human-like postures. Finally, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in the simulation. © 2021 SAE International. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The development of flexible multidigital grippers with both adaptive grasping and in-hand manipulation capabilities remains a complex issue for human-like dexterous manipulation. After four decades of research in dexterous manipulation, many robotic hands have been developed. The evaluation of these hands remains a key challenge. The design of the hand (degree of actuation, number of fingers, and joints) does not guarantee the real behavior of the hand and its performance. For comparison and evaluation purposes, the literature often refers to a potential dexterity, but very rarely provides an evaluation of the real dexterity of these grippers. The RoBioSS hand offers a high level of dexterity with inside-hand manipulation capabilities. In order to characterize the performance of the hand with regard to the state of the art, this article proposes an approach based on the dexterity analysis. It is based on the use of a known reference object and on defined grasps and movements of the object. The results presented allow us to evaluate grasps capabilities and quality of the object’s movement inside the hand. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of a new prototype robotic implant system for the placement of zygomatic implants in edentulous maxillary models. Methods: The study was carried out on eight plastic models. Cone beam computed tomographs were captured for each model to plan the positions of zygomatic implants. The hand-eye calibration technique was used to register the dynamic navigation system to the robotic spaces. A total of 16 zygomatic implants were placed, equally distributed between the anterior and the posterior parts of the zygoma. The placement of the implants (ZYGAN®, Southern Implants) was carried out using an active six-jointed robotic arm (UR3e, Universal Robots) guided by the dynamic navigation coordinate transformation matrix. The accuracy of the implant placement was assessed using EvaluNav and GeoMagicDesignX® software based on pre- and post-operative CBCT superimposition. Descriptive statistics for the implant deviations and Pearson's correlation analysis of these deviations to force feedback recorded by the robotic arm were conducted. Results: The 3D deviations at the entry and exit points were 1.80 ± 0.96 mm and 2.80 ± 0.95 mm, respectively. The angular deviation was 1.74 ± 0.92°. The overall registration time was 23.8 ± 7.0 min for each side of the model. Operative time excluding registration was 66.8 ± 8.8 min for each trajectory. The exit point and angular deviations of the implants were positively correlated with the drilling force perpendicular to the long axis of the handpiece and negatively correlated with the drilling force parallel to the long axis of the handpiece. Conclusion: The errors of the dynamic navigation-guided robotic placement of zygomatic implants were within the clinically acceptable limits. Further refinements are required to facilitate the clinical application of the tested integrated robotic-dynamic navigation system. Clinical significance: Robotic placement of zygomatic implants has the potential to produce a highly predictable outcome irrespective of the operator's surgical experience or fatigue. The presented study paves the way for clinical applications. © 2024 The Author(s)},

In order to improve the human-like autonomy of anthropomorphic robots in dynamic and unstructured environments, namely, predictable and human-like motion planning, this paper proposes an on-line motion planning method for a humanoid mobile dual-arm manipulator system. It involves two aspects: autonomous placement of the mobile base (MB) and human-like motion planning of the MB and two arms. In particular, the two aspects are achieved by introducing two relative inverse dynamic reachability maps: RiDRM and LiDRM. Since the construction of RiDRM and LiDRM is mainly done offline, the online efficiency is guaranteed. In fact, if an obstacle is detected online, the maps RiDRM and LiDRM are updated by only disabling the candidate end-poses which are in collision. Furthermore, predictable and human-like movements are achieved by optimizing a merit function that considers five criteria simultaneously. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2022 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

What these often lack is to achieve both a predictable, robust control for safe robot arm movements and implementation flexibility. Based on the iB2C-paradigm, this work presents an entirely behavior-based architecture distributed between the FPGA and processor parts of a SoPC. This combination allows the exploitation of advantages of both worlds. A behavior network realizing reactive kinematics and target approach is realized on the FPGA. Its hard real-time constraints, deterministic behavior, and quick update rates enable a safe execution. On a higher perception and control level, a second behavioral sub-network implemented in software on top of an OS is executed by the hard processor. This enables the use of open-source software and advanced programming languages as well as middleware, analysis, and supervision software. An interface abstraction tailored for this structure is introduced to satisfy the need for fast communication between the two computing units.

	abstract = {Global redundancy resolution (GRR) roadmap is a novel concept in robotics that facilitates the mapping from task space paths to configuration space paths in a legible, predictable, and repeatable way. Such roadmaps could find widespread utility in applications such as safe teleoperation, consistent path planning, and motion primitives generation. However, previous methods to compute GRR roadmaps often necessitate a lengthy computation time and produce non-smooth paths, limiting their practical efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method EXPANSION-GRR that leverages efficient configuration space projections and enables a rapid generation of smooth roadmaps that satisfy the task constraints. Additionally, we propose a simple multi-seed strategy that further enhances the final quality. We conducted experiments in simulation with a 5-link planar manipulator and a Kinova arm. We were able to generate the GRR roadmaps up to 2 orders of magnitude faster while achieving higher smoothness. We also demonstrate the utility of the GRR roadmaps in teleoperation tasks where our method outperformed prior methods and reactive IK solvers in terms of success rate and solution quality. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Assistive devices like exoskeletons undergo extensive testing not least because of their close interaction with humans. Conducting user studies is a time-consuming process that demands expert knowledge, and it is accompanied by challenges such as low repeatability and a potential lack of comparability between studies. Obtaining objective feedback on the exoskeleton’s performance is crucial for developers and manufacturers to iteratively improve the design and development process. This paper contributes to the concept of using robots for objective exoskeleton testing by presenting various approaches to a robotic-based testing platform for upper-body exoskeletons. We outline the necessary requirements for realistically simulating use cases and evaluate different approaches using standard manipulators as robotic motion generators. Three approaches are investigated: (i) Exploiting the anthropomorphic structure of the robotic arm and directly placing it into the exoskeleton. (ii) Utilizing a customized, direct attachment between the robot and exoskeleton. (iii) Attaching a human arm dummy to the robot end effector to simulate a more realistic interface with the exoskeleton. Subsequently, we discuss and compare the results against the aforementioned requirements of a systematic testing platform. Our conclusion emphasizes that achieving objective and realistic testing necessitates highly specialized hardware, algorithms, and further research to address challenging requirements. © 2024 by the authors.},

Furthermore, it may be necessary for the demonstrations to be accessible through a straightforward setup, such as a single visual sensor.

To perform this procedure, we present the TAICHI algorithm (Tracking Algorithm for Imitation of Complex Human Inputs). This method includes detecting key points on the human arm and mapping them to the robot, applying Gaussian filtering to smooth movements and reduce sensor noise, and utilizing an optimization algorithm to find the nearest configuration to the human arm while avoiding collisions with the environment or the robot itself. The novelty of this method lies in its utilization of key points from the human arm, specifically the end-effector and elbow, to derive a similar configuration for a non-Anthropomorphic arm. Through tests encompassing various movements performed at different speeds, we have validated the efficacy of our method and confirmed its efficiency in replicating the desired outcomes on the robot's end-effector and joints.  © 2023 IEEE.},

When the appropriate muscle internal forces are chosen, the arm end-point tracks the desired path via joint-space feedback. An objective function of the least-change rate of muscle forces is determined to find suitable feedback gains. The parameter defining the muscle force is then treated as a learning parameter through an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, incorporating the rate of change of muscle forces. In experimental section, the arm motion of healthy subjects is captured using the inertial measurement unit sensors, and then the image of the drawn path is processed. The inertial measurement unit sensors detect each segment motion’s orientation using quaternions, and the image is employed to identify the exact end-point position.

	abstract = {This paper presents an aerial platform capable of performing physically interactive tasks in unstructured environments with human-like dexterity under human supervision. This aerial platform consists of a humanoid torso attached to a hexacopter. A two-degree-of-freedom head and two five-degree-of-freedom arms equipped with SoftHands provide the requisite dexterity to allow human operators to carry out various tasks. A robust tendon-driven structure is purposefully designed for the arms, considerably reducing the impact of arm inertia on the aerial base in motion. In addition, tendons provide flexibility to the joints, which enhances the robustness of the arm preventing damage in interaction with the environment. To increase the payload of the aerial system and the battery life, we use the concept of Suspended Aerial Manipulation, i.e., the flying humanoid can be connected with a tether to a structure, e.g., a building, a fixed bracket, a supporting crane, or a larger airborne carrier. Importantly, to maximize portability and applicability, we adopt a modular approach exploiting commercial components for the aerial base hardware and autopilot. We develop an outer stabilizing control loop to maintain the attitude, compensating for the tether force and for the humanoid head and arm motions. The humanoid can be controlled by a remote operator, thus effectively realizing a Suspended Aerial Manipulation Avatar. The proposed system is validated through experiments in indoor scenarios reproducing post-disaster tasks. © 2024 The Authors.},

	abstract = {With the development of the times and the advancement of science and technology, the development of 3D animation has gradually been applied in various fields. In the field of mechanical control, three-dimensional animation has gradually become a very important application. In the actual application process, the use of three-dimensional animation effects cannot be applied in the field of mechanical control only by imagination. It must be applied in practice from the perspective of mechanical control. Analyze from its own stability and external factors to realize its application value. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of 3D animation in mechanical control mechanism. This article will take mechanical control as an entry point to discuss the application of three-dimensional animation in its mechanism. The research is carried out from two aspects. The first is the application of the robot arm. Based on the kinematic path planning of the shortest time priority strategy, the shorter the motion time of the robot arm, the faster the speed, and the vibration is more difficult to avoid. This is the vibration of the flexible arm. Improve its work efficiency, lay the foundation for more complex path planning problems; create conditions for lighter and faster robotic arm applications. The second is the application of the mechanical foot. The proposed ankle joint control strategy based on the lateral and forward cycle matching can be combined with the forward plane walking control strategy under the stable initial gait of the robot to realize the human-like virtual prototype of the biped robot. Dynamic walking for analysis. Experimental investigations have shown that in the process of normal walking, there is a dynamic swing process and a static support process. The swing process refers to the lifting of the foot to move forward or backward, and the supporting process refers to the immobilization of one foot to the other. One fulcrum on each foot allows it to move forwards and backwards. Among them, the dynamic swing process accounts for 40% of the whole process, and the static support process accounts for 60%. In general, based on these data, the three-dimensional robotic arm and three-dimensional robotic foot can be better studied. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {From the computational point of view, musculoskeletal control is the problem of controlling high degrees of freedom and dynamic multi-body system that is driven by redundant muscle units. A critical challenge in the control perspective of skeletal joints with antagonistic muscle pairs is finding methods robust to address this ill-posed nonlinear problem. To address this computational problem, we implemented a twofold optimization and learning framework to be specialized in addressing the redundancies in the muscle control. In the first part, we used model predictive control to obtain energy efficient skeletal trajectories to mimick human movements. The second part is to use deep reinforcement learning to obtain a sequence of stimulus to be given to muscles in order to obtain the skeletal trajectories with muscle control. We observed that the desired stimulus to muscles is only efficiently constructed by integrating the state and control input in a closed-loop setting as it resembles the proprioceptive integration in the spinal cord circuits. In this work, we showed how a variety of different reference trajectories can be obtained with optimal control and how these reference trajectories are mapped to the musculoskeletal control with deep reinforcement learning. Starting from the characteristics of human arm movement to obstacle avoidance experiment, our simulation results confirm the capabilities of our optimization and learning framework for a variety of dynamic movement trajectories. In summary, the proposed framework is offering a pipeline to complement the lack of experiments to record human motion-capture data as well as study the activation range of muscles to replicate the specific trajectory of interest. Using the trajectories from optimal control as a reference signal for reinforcement learning implementation has allowed us to acquire optimum and human-like behaviour of the musculoskeletal system which provides a framework to study human movement in-silico experiments. The present framework can also allow studying upper-arm rehabilitation with assistive robots given that one can use healthy subject movement recordings as reference to work on the control architecture of assistive robotics in order to compensate behavioural deficiencies. Hence, the framework opens to possibility of replicating or complementing labour-intensive, time-consuming and costly experiments with human subjects in the field of movement studies and digital twin of rehabilitation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {How to generate anthropomorphic reaching movement remains a challenging problem in service robots and human motor function repair/reconstruction equipment. However, there is no universally accepted computational model in the literature for reproducing the motion of the human upper limb. In response to the problem, this article presents a computational framework for generating reaching movement endowed with human motion characteristics that imitated the mechanism in the control and realization of human upper limb motions. This article first establishes the experimental paradigm of human upper limb functional movements and proposes the characterization of human upper limb movement characteristics and feature movement clustering methods in the joint space. Then, according to the specific task requirements of the upper limb, combined with the human sensorimotor model, the estimation method of the human upper limb natural postures was established. Next, a continuous task parametric model matching the characteristic motion class is established by using the Gaussian mixture regression method. The anthropomorphic motion generation method with the characteristics of the smooth trajectory and the ability of natural obstacle avoidance is proposed. Finally, the anthropomorphic motion generation method proposed in this article is verified by a human-like robot. The measurement index of the human-likeness degree of the trajectory is given. The experimental results show that for all four tested tasks, the human-likeness degrees were greater than 90.8%, and the trajectories' jerk generated by this method is very similar to the trajectories' jerk of humans, which validates the proposed method.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Learning from demonstration (LfD) has been successfully applied for learning tasks on robots, for which the human tutor can demonstrate a successful execution. Learning human stiffness schedule strategy is one of the promising approaches for lightweight collaborative robots to execute physical in-contact tasks while remaining compliant when possible, as it enables robots to show human-like adaptive impedance behavior in an effective and efficient manner. In this letter, we develop a robot skill learning framework considering both movement and impedance features. Electromyography (EMG)-based method is used to estimate human upper limb stiffness such that the information of impedance can be obtained. Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) model is employed to model movement and impedance features simultaneously. Throughout this procedure, the robot skills learning from a human tutor can be achieved. Besides, the learned skills can be generalized. An impedance controller imitating the human impedance mechanism is utilized in the task reproduction phase to achieve both task successful execution and safe physical interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified in a water pumping task on a Kinova robot.  © 2016 IEEE.},

Haptify records the interaction between the hand, device, and ground with a seven-camera optical motion-capture system, a 60-cm-square custom force plate, and a customized sensing end-effector. We demonstrate six key ways to assess GFF device performance: workspace shape, global free-space forces, global free-space vibrations, local dynamic forces and torques, frictionless surface rendering, and stiffness rendering. We then use Haptify to benchmark two commercial haptic devices. With a smaller workspace than the 3D Systems Touch, the more expensive Touch X outputs smaller free-space forces and vibrations, smaller and more predictable dynamic forces and torques, and higher-quality renderings of a frictionless surface and high stiffness.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

However, research in this area is scarce. This paper aims to investigate the optimal structural configuration of a humanoid arm in the workspace around the upper body (WAUB). For this purpose, we initiate by analyzing the reachability data of human arm in the WAUB and subsequently propose a design strategy that incorporates this human data into the humanoid arm design. The proposed strategy consists of two key components: a structural parameter optimization method based on the postural reachability of task points and a task point identification method tailored to the WAUB. The optimization process leverages the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) and integrates collision-free control into each optimization iteration for realistic arm motion. The task point identification involves defining an expected workspace derived from human data and selecting task points through analysis of the hard-to-reach areas. Humanoid upper body models are introduced considering the anthropomorphic contour of human body and humanoid shoulder features. Performance tests conducted on these models assess the effectiveness of optimization. The results can offer practical insights for humanoid arm design. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The applications and requirements of a complete robotic arm from shoulder to fingers are obvious for hand disabled people. The reported research toward hardware development and its operations of a complete robotic arm is limited and needs to accelerate for the betterment of society. However, it is a very challenging task to design and develop a human-like five-fingered robotic arm due to more number of degrees of freedom required to provide the sufficient flexibility. It is also challenging to ensure precise autonomous motion of the full arm to following the reference trajectory in order to approach and grasp the object. In this paper, we present the detailed description of the design and development of a 20-DOF (3-DOF shoulder, 1-DOF elbow, 1-DOF wrist, 3-DOF thumb and 3-DOF each finger) robotic arm. The main objectives are to develop a human-mimic robotic arm having higher degrees of freedom, competitive physical capabilities and able to perform precise motion while approaching and grasping an object. The presented robotic arm is designed in SolidWorks and implemented using ROS library. The mathematical analysis of its kinematics is also provided to design the control system and motion planning algorithms as per the requirement. A novel motion planning and control algorithm is also introduced to govern the motion of the full arm and perform accurate grasping. The performance of the developed robotic arm is compared with the existing arms on the basis of accuracy in motion while approaching and grasping an object. It has been observed that the physical strength of the developed arm is quite competitive, while it outperforms others in motion accuracy. Results have been verified by the hardware experiments and further validated by the statistical technique. © King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals 2024.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design and development of an aerial-ground robotics testbed for simulating bimanual manipulation operations on orbit relying on aerial robotics platforms, considering as representative use case the capture and maintenance of a non-cooperative free-floating satellite. The proposed testbed design is intended to facilitate the realization of simulations involving physical interaction, taking benefit of the technologies derived from aerial robotic manipulation, to be used as a complementary or alternative solution to existing ground testbed facilities. The system consists of a fully actuated multi-rotor (FAMR) that emulates the free flying/free floating dynamics of a target satellite, and a lightweight and compliant anthropomorphic dual arm system (LiCAS) to conduct the manipulation task, implementing the dynamics simulation in Simscape Multibody. The human-size and human-like kinematics of the LiCAS allow to replicate the manipulation skills of human operators, whereas its very low weight (2.5 kg) makes it possible to mount it on lightweight industrial robotic arms used to reproduce the spacecraft motion. Two types of compliant interactions are considered. On the one hand, impedance control for the post-contact phase is implemented in the simulation layer, using the right arm to hold the target and maintain the relative pose with the base while the left arm conducts the manipulation task. On the other hand, collision detection and passive accommodation is evaluated in the physical testing system relying on the mechanical joint compliance of the LiCAS dual arm. Collision reflexes between the free-floating FAMR and the compliant arm will be also experimentally evaluated by applying the principle of momentum conservation on the multi-rotor. The proposed approach takes benefit of the similarities between space and aerial robotic manipulation in terms of dynamic modeling, presenting simulation and experimental results in an indoor testbed to validate the developed framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Because of their unique adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, musculoskeletal robotic systems are regarded potentially as next-generation robots. However, motion learning and generation of such a robotic system are still challenging. This paper presents a neuromuscular control method, namely, TMS-PPO, based on time-varying muscle synergy (TMS) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). The electromyogram (EMG) activation signals of actual human motions are decomposed to obtain TMSs based on the temporal properties of the TMS. The weights of networks are trained to generate the scale and phase coefficients through the PPO. The coefficients modulate the TMSs to generate appropriate activation patterns to optimize motion learning of the musculoskeletal system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the TMSs are extracted from human upper limb muscle activation signals, and we compare TMS-PPO with PPO in the motion learning and generation process of an upper limb musculoskeletal system. The results show that TMS-PPO can complete the control tasks because the average errors of the joints are less than 0.05 rad. In the meantime, TMSs are used as motion primitives of the musculoskeletal system to simulate the process of the human CNS controlling muscles. It shows that TMS-PPO reduces the energy consumption and improves the learning rate significantly compared with the PPO. The learning episodes reduce from 104 to 103, which indicates that TMS-PPO has a stronger learning ability and better physiological explanation.Note to Practitioners - Due to the superiorities of the musculoskeletal system, humanoid robots that imitate human driven mechanisms are vigorously carried out worldwide. Taking advantages of human-like characteristics, the musculoskeletal robot provides new opportunities to understand and validate the human mechanisms of muscle control and motion learning, to compare the performance of the robot to that of humans as well as work in real world, e.g., human interactive robots, amusement robots and medical training robots in the future. However, strong redundancy, coupling, and nonlinearity of the system also raises many challenges for the investigation of the control problem. Inspired by how the human CNS controls a musculoskeletal system and realize motion generalization, a novel muscle-synergies-based neuromuscular control that combines time-varying muscle synergy (TMS) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), namely, TMS-PPO is proposed in this paper. The learning efficiency of PPO and the physiological interpretation of the control process are improved during the motion learning and generation processes of the musculoskeletal system. Preliminary simulation experiments suggest that this method is feasible in terms of control accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the performance of the TMS-PPO is comparable to the PPO without significant improvement. To solve this problem, in future work, we will introduce the cerebellar model into the control method which plays the role of adjusting and correcting the motions of the limbs to achieve accurate and stable control in the actions process of humans.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

In fact, this feature allows human peers to easily predict the robot's intention, which is perfectly aligned with the paradigm of collaborative industries, contributing to more human-centric and resilient industries. The one-sixth power law (1/6-PL) is well known in human motor control. In this work, the Human-like Upper-limb Motion Planner is used to generate three-dimensional (3D) movements of an anthropomorphic robotic arm. By applying direct kinematics, the position and orientation of the hand of the robot is determined. Subsequently, the respective curvature, torsion and velocity are computed. From a total of 600 movements, divided in six sessions, non-linear regression models are fitted and validated, in order to obtain the slope in the log-space of these movements. A statistical analysis of the parameters of the 1/6-PL is performed, and parametric and non-parametric tests are used to compare the results in each of the six sessions. © 2022 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Robot musicians have the potential to revolutionise the way humans perceive and create music. Recent breakthroughs in this field have tended to focus more on the digital generation of music. Instead, we address how a musician’s physical embodiment can be translated to a robotic arm. Robots endowed with human-like musical capability open the possibility for wider applications such as human-robot bands, musical education and musical art. Prior work in this area tends to rely on pre-programmed actuation which is limited to simple motion and sound. In this paper, we propose a robotic system capable of imitating a human musician, with a focus on percussion instruments. Our system consists of a method for recording the human demonstration, a compact continuous representation of the demonstrated motion and a motion reproduction method which considers the dynamic constraints of the robot. We present results of our system and show that it is capable of closely reproducing the motion of the human percussionist. © 2023 Australasian Robotics and Automation Association.

We propose a simple and easy-to-use human-like motion planning algorithm of anthropomorphic arms based on hierarchical strategy. By setting the trigger conditions of the end-effector's position and attitude, the motion of the robotic arm is divided into reaching stage and grasping stage. The end-effector velocity is planned using minimum jerk model, and a clamping function is applied to improve the smoothness of the motion. The inverse kinematics is solved using selectively damped least squares method, which can avoid singularities. To deal with the redundancy problem, a human-like pose optimization function based on the principle of minimum potential energy is defined, which is solved using gradient projection method.

Firstly, the end of the robot is dynamically modeled using an admittance control model to give the robot flexibility. Secondly, the dynamic movement primitives are employed to model the robot’s motion trajectory. Additionally, novel stiffness primitives and damping primitives are introduced to model the stiffness and damping parameters in the impedance model. The combination of the dynamic movement primitives, stiffness primitives, and damping primitives is called the hybrid primitive framework.

	abstract = {Inspired by the driving muscles of the human arm, a 4-Degree of Freedom (DOF) concentrated driving humanoid robotic arm is proposed based on a spatial double parallel four-bar mechanism. The four-bar mechanism design reduces the inertia of the elbow-driving unit and the torque by 76.65% and 57.81%, respectively. Mimicking the human pose regulation strategy that the human arm picks up a heavy object by adjusting its posture naturally without complicated control, the robotic arm features an integrated position-level closed-form inverse solution method considering both geometric and load capacity limitations. This method consists of a geometric constraint model incorporating the arm angle (φ) and the Global Configuration (GC) to avoid joint limits and singularities, and a load capacity model to constrain the feasible domain of the arm angle. Further, trajectory tracking simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility of the proposed inverse solution method. The simulated maximum output torque, maximum output power and total energy consumption of the robotic arm are reduced by up to 2.0%, 13.3%, and 33.3%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the robotic arm can bear heavy loads in a human-like posture, effectively reducing the maximum output torque and energy consumption of the robotic arm by 1.83% and 5.03%, respectively, while avoiding joints beyond geometric and load capacity limitations. The proposed design provides a high payload–weight ratio and an efficient pose control solution for robotic arms, which can potentially broaden the application spectrum of humanoid robots. © Jilin University 2024.},

	abstract = {Traditional industrial robots are generally massive, heavy, and dangerous and are therefore generally isolated from humans. Collaborative robots or COBOTs are designed to collaborate and work with humans in a shared workspace. These are typically smaller and lighter than traditional industrial robots and are therefore more flexible and easier to deploy in a variety of settings. One of the most crucial problems that need to be addressed for cobots is Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance as they will be working in an environment where there will be constant human movement. This paper presents an efficient solution to this problem employing a Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) for realtime path planning. It has been used to obtain the most optimum trajectory while avoiding dynamic obstacles. The KINOVA Gen3 manipulator has been simulated with static and dynamic obstacle modelling. The NMPC controls the arm to minimize differences between the system's current state and the desired goal position while avoiding obstacles. A detailed visualization of the system motion has also been included. The work has been tested and the results have been shown for 4 different cases - reference case with no obstacles, case 1 with three obstacles, case 2 with four obstacles and case 3 with a simulated human-like obstacle to mimic a typical cobot scenario. Detailed error analysis including end-effector and implementation errors has also been shown for each of the 4 cases and is promising.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Bipedal walking robots are advancing research by performing challenging human-like movements in complex environments. Particularly, wheeled-bipedal robots are used in many indoor environments by overcoming the speed and maneuverability limitations of bipedal walking robots without wheels. However, when both wheels lose contact with the ground, maintaining lateral balance becomes challenging, and there is an increased risk of toppling over. Furthermore, utilizing robotic arms similar to human arms, in addition to wheel-based balance, could enable more precise and stable control. In this paper, we develop a wheeled-bipedal robot that is able to jump and drive while also being able to cross its legs and balance on one leg (the OLEBOT). The OLEBOT is designed with a hand-fan-shaped end-effector capable of generating compensatory torque. By tilting the hand-fan-shaped end-effector in the opposite direction, OLEBOT achieves pitch control and single-leg balance. In jumping scenario, it imitates the arm movements of a person performing stationary high jumps, while utilizing a cam-based leg joint system to boost jump height. In addition, this paper develops a control architecture based on model predictive control (MPC) to ensure stable posture in driving, jumping, and one-legged balancing scenarios for OLEBOT. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that OLEBOT is capable of maintaining a stable posture using a wheeled-bipedal system and achieving balance in a one-legged stance. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Dexterous manipulation concerns the control of a robot hand to manipulate an object in a desired manner. While classical dexterous manipulation strategies are based on stable grasping (or force closure), many human-like manipulation tasks do not maintain grasp stability and often utilize the dynamics of the object rather than the closed form of kinematic relation between the object and the robotic hand. Such manipulation strategies are referred as nonprehensile or dynamic dexterous manipulation in the literature. Nonprehensile manipulation often involves fast and agile movements such as throwing and flipping. Due to the complexity of such motions and uncertainties associated with them, it has been challenging to realize nonprehensile manipulation tasks in a reliable way. In this paper, we propose a new control strategy to realize practical nonprehensile manipulation. First, we make explicit use of multiple modalities of sensory data for the design of control law. Specifically, force data are employed for feedforward control, while position data are used for feedback control. Secondly, control signals (both feedback and feedforward) are obtained through multisensory learning from demonstration (LfD) experiments designed and performed for specific nonprehensile manipulation tasks of concern. To prove the concept of the proposed control strategy, experimental tests were conducted for a dynamic spinning task using a sensory-rich, two-finger robotic hand. The control performance (i.e., the speed and accuracy of the spinning task) was also compared with that of classical dexterous manipulation based on force closure and finger gaiting. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Master-slave telemanipulation of a humanoid robot arm is one of the challenging and intuitive control tasks that is being studied to achieve human-like competency in remotely operated collaborative robots. Traditional inverse kinematics-based manipulation typically produces highly complex and non-unique solutions and has the risk of running into singularity conditions for a higher degree of freedom manipulator. On the other hand, pendant-based teaching manipulation is suitable for only predefined trajectories. As the use of telemanipulation is increasing in collaborative robots to support better human-robot interactions, it is becoming critical to explore alternative novel, simple, and innovative manipulation strategies. In this study, we propose an iterative search-based efficient actuation method for the telemanipulation of collaborative master-slave robot arms. The forward kinematic model used in the iterative algorithm is developed using Denavit–Hartenberg parameters, and a manipulation platform with data glove is designed to map the position and orientation of the master arm. Using the iterative algorithm, on average, the end-effector of the robot arm can be within 18.5 mm of required positions in a 106 mm3 sub-workspace (0.63% error). Our study also presents a series of experimental executions on hardware, iterations, and errors to demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed algorithm. Copyright © 2023 by ASME.},

	abstract = {The inverse kinematics problem of exoskeleton rehabilitation robots is challenging due to the lack of a standard analytical model, resulting in a complex and varied solution process. This complexity is especially pronounced in redundant upper limb exoskeleton robots, where inefficient solutions hinder the robot’s ability to adapt to the kinematic shape of the upper limb. This paper proposes a modeling and solution method based on multi-objective optimization to address the inverse kinematics of upper limb exoskeleton robots. We analyzed and validated this method using a redundant upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot system developed by ourselves. First, we established a multi-objective inverse kinematics solution model by defining the end-position function, joint motion comfort function, system energy consumption function, motion safety, and human-like constraints. Then, the solution was designed based on the Improved Equilibrium Optimization (IEO) algorithm and validated its computational performance in terms of optimization ability, accuracy, and robustness. Finally, we experimentally tested the inverse kinematics solution model with the IEO algorithm on discrete objectives and continuous training trajectories using a redundant upper limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot system. The results show that by incorporating the joint comfort function, system energy consumption function, and human-like constraints into the inverse kinematics model, we can not only quickly solve the inverse kinematics of redundant upper limb exoskeleton robots but also significantly improve the robot’s motion shape. Furthermore, it has better solution accuracy and stronger robustness than other algorithms when solving this inverse kinematics model based on the IEO algorithm. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a common vascular disease with blood clots inside deep veins, which may block blood flow or even cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. A typical exam for DVT using ultrasound (US) imaging is by pressing the target vein until its lumen is fully compressed. However, the compression exam is highly operator-dependent. To alleviate intra- and inter-variations, we present a robotic US system with a novel hybrid force motion control scheme ensuring position and force tracking accuracy, and soft landing of the probe onto the target surface. In addition, a path-based virtual fixture is proposed to realize easy human-robot interaction for repeat compression operation at the lesion location. To ensure the biometric measurements obtained in different examinations are comparable, the 6D scanning path is determined in a coarse-to-fine manner using both an external RGBD camera and US images. The RGBD camera is first used to extract a rough scanning path on the object. Then, the segmented vascular lumen from US images are used to optimize the scanning path to ensure the visibility of the target object. To generate a continuous scan path for developing virtual fixtures, an arc-length based path fitting model considering both position and orientation is proposed. Finally, the whole system is evaluated on a human-like arm phantom with an uneven surface. The code (https://github.com/dianyeHuang/RobDVTUS) and intuitive demonstration video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xFyqU1rV8c) can be publicly accessed. Note to Practitioners - Robotic ultrasound (US) systems have attracted attention for various applications in the past decades. However, the existing studies are not mature and intelligent enough for some challenging applications, such as DVT exam, which requires rich contact interaction between patients and clinicians. To tackle with this challenge, this study presents a novel human-centric robotic DVT exam program using the technique of virtual fixture. The coarse-to-fine path planning module ensures the repeatability of US acquisitions carried out at different times. During DVT exam, the proposed continuous 6D path virtual fixture can guide clinicians to freely move the probe along the scan path while limiting the probe motion in other directions. In order to perform the compress-release exam, a decoupled position/force controller is developed to precisely generate the contact force conveyed by clinicians and to restrict the probe motion along the probe centerline. We believe such a robot-assisted system is a promising solution to take both advantages of robots about the accuracy and repeatability and human operators about the advanced physiological knowledge.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Democratization of prosthetic devices has been made possible by the availability of desktop 3D printers. Low-cost body-powered open-sourced prosthetic devices are a first choice for many patients with upper limb amputations. However, the design of these devices often stems from a ‘one shape fits all’ archetype and therefore user acceptance varies. Little or no consideration is given to kinematics, size, weight or aesthetics. Novel devices reported in the literature rely on mathematical optimization of kinematic parameters to achieve human-like finger trajectories and forces. However, these devices are not open-source and lack user testing and feedback. This paper presents the design process for a new open-source low-cost 3D printed prosthetic finger, customized for an individual amputee. Parametric optimization was used to determine key dimensional parameters for simultaneous actuation of the prosthetic medial and distal phalanges. The amputee user participated in the conceptualization and testing phases of the design process. Two design iterations are presented with user feedback on fit, comfort and functionality to validate the design. The most recent iteration included three user adjustments for fine-tuning the degree of actuation. This iteration permitted desirable actuation and grasping.

However, the highly anthropomorphic structure and high motion redundancy pose numerous challenges in developing a high-precision control scheme that is trackable, predictable, and adaptable in complex scenarios. Most research focuses on single-task operations, lacking cohesive strategies for multi-task coordination in dual-manipulator robots. This paper presents a detailed mathematical model and kinematic analysis of the MDMCR, along with a novel coordination strategy designed to optimize cooperative precision and prevent self-collision between the arms within a switching mode based on a cooperation index. Additionally, an innovative control scheme for mode switching of the MDMCR is established by incorporating kinematic constraints, joint limit constraints, and obstacle avoidance into a dynamic quadratic programming (DQP) problem, which is efficiently solved using discrete-time primal-dual neural network (DT-PDNN). Through numerical experiments under two modes and comparative experiments with the traditional method, the effectiveness of the cooperation strategy based on the cooperation index has been verified. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

However, when it comes to the motion of the robot's working arm, it is crucial to achieve what is commonly referred to as human-like movement. Failure to achieve this can lead to feelings of fear or discomfort when observing the robot. In order to address this issue, research has been conducted on generating human-like movement by applying machine learning based on human motion. Furthermore, a multi-class classification model is identified using a system identification method called Element Description Method (EDM) to select the most human-like motion from multiple motion plans obtained through inverse kinematics. To improve the accuracy of EDM, actual human joint angles are used as training data, along with questionnaire results on movements considered to be human-like when performed in positions beyond the reach of humans. The generated learning model is then validated for its accuracy, and finally, a comparison is made to evaluate the differences with conventional machine learning methods.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The anthropo-morphic manipulator has a structure similar to a human arm. We propose a human-like motion plan-ning method for moving target scenarios. We use dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) to model the anthropomorphic manipulator's end-effector motion. Compared to the conventional DMPs formalism, the proposed method contains the following extensions:1) an orientation-based spatial scaling,2) online temporal scaling parameter adaptation with moving targets feed-back. And we use a deep residual convolution neural network (ResCNN) to model the elbow motion of the anthropomorphic manipulator. Based on these models, real-time trajectory planning is performed for the moving target. In real-time motion planning, there is no need to model the moving target; only the moving tar-get's current position and velocity information is used to obtain a human-like motion of the anthropomorphic manipulator regarding posture and velocity. Simulation experiments on the Kinova Jaco2 in Coppeliasim show that our approach is practical.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robotic ultrasound (US) imaging has been seen as a promising solution to overcome the limitations of free-hand US examinations, i.e., interoperator variability. However, the fact that robotic US systems (RUSSs) cannot react to subject movements during scans limits their clinical acceptance. Regarding human sonographers, they often react to patient movements by repositioning the probe or even restarting the acquisition, in particular for the scans of anatomies with long structures like limb arteries. To realize this characteristic, we proposed a vision-based system to monitor the subject's movement and automatically update the scan trajectory thus seamlessly obtaining a complete 3-D image of the target anatomy. The motion monitoring module is developed using the segmented object masks from RGB images. Once the subject is moved, the robot will stop and recompute a suitable trajectory by registering the surface point clouds of the object obtained before and after the movement using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. Afterward, to ensure optimal contact conditions after repositioning US probe, a confidence-based fine-tuning process is used to avoid potential gaps between the probe and contact surface. Finally, the whole system is validated on a human-like arm phantom with an uneven surface, while the object segmentation network is also validated on volunteers. The results demonstrate that the presented system can react to object movements and reliably provide accurate 3-D images. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to present a new kinematics mapping method based on dynamic equivalent points. In teleoperation, this method enables a robotic (follower) arm to mimic human (leader) arm postures and avoid obstacles in a human-like manner. Design/methodology/approach: The information of the human arm is extracted based on the characteristics of human arm motion, and the concept of equivalent points is introduced. Then, an equivalent point is determined to transform the robotic arm with a nonhuman-like kinematic structure into an anthropomorphic robotic arm. Based on this equivalent point, a mapping method is developed to ensure that the two arms are similar. Finally, the similarity between the human elbow angle and robot elbow angle is further improved by using this method and an augmented Jacobian matrix with a compensation coefficient. Findings: Numerical simulations and physical prototype experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. In environments with obstacles, this method can adjust the position of the equivalent point in real time to avoid obstacles. In environments without obstacles, the similarity between the human elbow angle and robot elbow angle is further improved at the expense of the end-effector accuracy. Originality/value: This study presents a new kinematics mapping method, which can realize the complete mapping between the human arm and heterogeneous robotic arm in teleoperation. This method is versatile and can be applied to various mechanical arms with different structures. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In order to help anthropomorphic arms produce precise human-like motions, this research introduces a unique planning method for human-like movements. Movement primitives, a Bayesian network (BN), and a new Long Short Term Memory network make up the three elements of the approach (LSTM). Human arm movements are broken down using movement primitives, and classifying arm motions improves the realism of human-like motions. The probability that a movement will occur is predicted using a motion-decision algorithm based on Bayesian Netwrok, which also chooses the best mode of motion. A brand new LSTM is also created to address the inverse kinematics issues with anthropomorphic arms. Several models are combined into a single network using the LSTM, which modifies the network's structure to reflect the properties of the individual models. The suggested method enables anthropomorphic arms to accurately produce a variety of human-like actions. Lastly, simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of the suggested technique. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In human-human communication, humans observe each other’s behavioral actions, and infer each other’s internal states such as intentions and emotions to build relationships. In order to establish relationships between humans and robots, robots need to recognize human actions and infer human intentions as well as to indicate robot’s own internal states to be perceived by humans. The studies in robots’ internal states indications are based on the idea of giving robots understandable human-like characteristics that allow human to infer the internal states and encourage the anthropomorphizing in interaction. However, it lacks a basic exploration from the cognitive perspective that how humans interpret robots body languages, and from what kind of bodily movements humans perceive and infer robots’ internal state. In this paper, we designed and developed a CG character to investigate what cues humans take in intention inference. The CG character was of independent and moveable head, eyes, and right arm. The intention inference task was as simple as predicting which cup the character would grasp. We further analyzed the participants’ gaze points in the experiment obtained by an eye tracking device. The results suggested that the CG character’s eyes (gaze) have the strong impact in intention inference, and that humans tend to gaze at CG character’s eyes and take the gaze of the CG character as the cue. © 2024 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

	abstract = {Motion generation seeks to produce safe and feasible robot motion from start to goal. Various tools at different levels of granularity have been developed. On one extreme, sampling-based motion planners focus on completeness - a solution, if it exists, would eventually be found. However, produced paths are often of low quality, and contain superfluous motion. On the other, reactive methods optimise the immediate cost to obtain the next controls, producing smooth and legible motion that can quickly adapt to perturbations, uncertainties, and changes in the environment. However, reactive methods are highly local, and often produce motion that become trapped in non-convex regions of the environment. This paper contributes, Geometric Fabric Command Sequences, a method that lies in the middle ground. It can produce globally optimal motion that is smooth and intuitive, while being also reactive. We model motion via a reactive Geometric Fabric policy that ingests a sequence of attractor states, or commands, and then apply global optimisation over the space of commands. We postulate that solutions for different problems and scenes are highly transferable when conditioned on environmental features. Therefore, an implicit generative model is trained on solutions from optimisation and environment features in a self-supervised manner. That is, faced with multiple motion generation problems, the learning and optimisation are contained within the same loop: the optimisation generates labels for learning, while the learning improves the optimisation for the next problem, which in turn provides higher quality labels. We empirically validate our method in both simulation and on a real-world 6-DOF JACO arm. © 2023 IEEE.},

It is essential to improve the multijoint coordination ability for stroke patients by integrating the synergy pattern into rehabilitation tasks and trajectory design. However, current robot-assisted rehabilitation systems tend to overlook the incorporation of a multijoint synergy model. This article proposes postural synergistic kernelized movement primitives (PSKMP) method for the human-like trajectory planning of robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation. First, the demonstrated trajectory obtained from the motion capture system is subject to principal component analysis to extract postural synergies. Then, the PSKMP is proposed by kernelizing the postural synergistic subspaces with the kernel treatment to preserve human natural movement characteristics. Finally, the rehabilitation trajectory accord with human motion habits can be generated based on generalized postural synergistic subspaces. This approach has undergone practical validation on an upper limb rehabilitation robot, and the experimental results show that the proposed method enables the generation of human-like trajectories adapted to new task points, in accordance with the natural movement style of human. This method holds great significance in promoting the recovery of coordination ability of stroke patients. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this study, we propose the use of the phase-amplitude reduction method to construct an imitation learning framework. Imitating human movement trajectories is recognized as a promising strategy for generating a range of human-like robot movements. Unlike previous dynamical system-based imitation learning approaches, our proposed method allows the robot not only to imitate a limit cycle trajectory but also to replicate the transient movement from the initial or disturbed state to the limit cycle. Consequently, our method offers a safer imitation learning approach that avoids generating unpredictable motions immediately after disturbances or from a specified initial state. We first validated our proposed method by reconstructing a simple limit-cycle attractor. We then compared the proposed approach with a conventional method on a lemniscate trajectory tracking task with a simulated robot arm. Our findings confirm that our proposed method can more accurately generate transient movements to converge on a target periodic attractor compared to the previous standard approach. Subsequently, we applied our method to a real robot arm to imitate periodic human movements. © 2024 The Author(s).

We propose "on-the-go"handovers which permit a moving mobile manipulator to hand over an object to a human without stopping. The on-the-go handover motion is generated with a reactive controller that allows simultaneous control of the base and the arm. In a user study, human receivers subjectively assessed on-the-go handovers to be more efficient, predictable, natural, better timed and safer than handovers that implemented a "stop-and-deliver"behavior. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Mimicking of human-like arm movement characteristics involves considering three factors during control policy synthesis: (a) task requirements, (b) noise during movement execution, and (c) optimality principles. Previous studies showed that when these factors (a-c) are considered individually, it is possible to synthesize arm movements that either kinematically match experimental data or reproduce the stereotypical triphasic muscle activation pattern. However, no quantitative comparison has assessed the realism of arm movements generated by each factor, nor has it been determined whether combining these factors results in movements with human-like kinematic characteristics and the triphasic muscle pattern. To investigate this, we used reinforcement learning to learn a control policy for a musculoskeletal arm model, aiming to discern which combination of factors (a-c) results in realistic arm movements according to four frequently reported stereotypical characteristics. Our findings indicate that incorporating velocity and acceleration requirements into the reaching task, employing reward terms that minimize mechanical work, hand jerk, and control effort, along with the inclusion of noise during movement, leads to realistic human arm movements by reinforcement learning. We expect that the gained insights will help in the future to better predict desired arm movements and corrective forces in wearable assistive devices. © 2024 IEEE.},

A critical aspect of this field, particularly concerning the movement of the human upper limb, is the redundancy resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel trajectory planning method aimed at addressing the redundancy resolution in reaching motions related to Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This method is inspired by prior studies on maximum manipulability while emphasizing the natural upper limb posture, particularly the human preference for maintaining a nearly steady elbow position during ADL movements unless, of course, the range of the desired motion requires otherwise. A trajectory-combining approach is developed for generating trajectories in the human configuration space. Additionally, we present a configuration transformation model for human-robot configuration alignment. Experimental results validate the hypothesis of a steady elbow position and combine features from the Minimum Jerk (MJ) and Minimum Angular Jerk (MAJ) methods, demonstrating more natural reaching motions. The configuration transformation model has been successfully tested on the TAMU CLEVERarm, a lightweight and compact upper limb exoskeleton. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Robots with human-like appearances and structures are usually well accepted in the human-robot interaction. However, compared with human-like appearances and structures, the human-like motion plays a much more critical role in improving the efficiency and safety of the human-robot interaction. This paper develops a human-like motion planner based on human arm motion patterns (HAMPs) to fulfill the human-robot object handover tasks. First, a handover task is divided into two sub-tasks, that is, pick-up and delivery, and HAMPs are extracted for these two sub-tasks separately. The resulting HAMPs are analyzed, and a method is proposed to select HAMPs that can represent the characteristics of the human arm motion. Then the factors affecting the duration of the movement primitives are analyzed, and the relationship between the duration of the movement primitives and these factors is determined. Based on the selected HAMP and the computed duration of the movement primitives, a human-like motion planning framework is developed to generate the human-like motion for the robotic arms. Finally, this motion planner is verified by the human-robot handover experiments using a KUKA IIWA robot. It shows that the resulting trajectories can correctly reflect the relative relationship between the joints in the human arm motion and are very close to the recorded human arm trajectories. Furthermore, the proposed motion planning method is compared with the motion planning method based on minimum total potential energy. The results show that the proposed method can generate more human-like motion.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As a mimic of the human arm structure, anthropomorphic manipulators with radial elbow offset (AMREO) are often deployed on humanoid service robots. However, the unique offset leads to difficulties in solving the analytical inverse kinematics (IK), which poses a challenge for further anthropomorphic control. This paper presents an integrated scheme for solving the path-wise IK problem of a 7-DoF AMREO in the position domain. Unlike other approaches, special attention is paid to the naturalness of the arm configuration, with the aim of making AMREO exhibit human-like behavior in human-centered environments. First, an analytical IK solution of AMREO for a single end-effector pose is derived based on the arm angle parameterization. Then, inspired by the habitual arm configurations in human reaching movements, the natural arm configuration mapped to wrist position is proposed for AMREO. To learn the patterns implied therein, a LSTM-based natural arm angle prediction network (NAPN) is designed and trained based on a human demonstration dataset. Finally, a redundancy resolution framework embedded with NAPN is built to generate smooth and natural joint configurations in the path-wise IK tasks. Comparative experiments show that the proposed analytical IK algorithm has better computational efficiency and precision than conventional methods, and can give complete results for one IK call within 4 μs. In addition, continuous path tracking experiments on a real robot validate the effectiveness and anthropomorphism of the redundancy resolution scheme based on NAPN. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

It was validated on a simulated arm and whip system with 54 degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), whose objective is to minimize the distance between the whip tip and a target in a 3D space. As a result, our integration of data-driven and physics-based algorithms allows for 89% improvement of hitting effectiveness and >72% reductions of joint motion tracking control errors, compared to traditional learning and control algorithms.

	abstract = {Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) aims to make a robot learn optimal policy from expert demonstrations. However, its application mainly focuses on the robot's partial body control, such as the mechanical arm, and is rarely applied in whole-body action learning. Although making robots mimic human behavior has always been a mesmerizing goal in robotics, it is challenging for GAIL to reproduce complex human-like behaviors because of unsatisfactory performance. Furthermore, for multi-dimensional complex humanoid action imitation, only using output from discriminator may limit the performance of GAIL. To solve these problems, we propose a method, Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning from Human Behavior with Reward Shaping (GAIL-RS), enabling the robot to learn humanoid behaviors effectively. Instead of directly learning policy, a reward shaping mechanism is incorporated to improve the discriminator's performance. In addition, we utilize the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm as our generator to enhance imitation performance. Experiments were conducted on two robotic humanoid imitation tasks in simulation. The results demonstrate that our method can learn the optimal policy from reference motion and performs better than other methods. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many rehabilitation exoskeletons have been used in the field of stroke rehabilitation. Generating human-like motion is necessary for exoskeletons to help patients perform activities of daily living (ADL) while maintaining interaction quality and ergonomics. However, most of the current motion generation algorithms utilize inverse kinematics (IK) to solve the final configuration before generation, and do not consider the movement of shoulder girdle. Separately considering the shoulder girdle motion and arm motion, this paper proposes an algorithm integrated IK to generate human-like motion. The arm moves towards the target with a bell-shaped velocity in the absence of the final configuration, and the shoulder girdle maintain natural passive motion. Moreover, the generated motion can be mapped to the configuration space of exoskeletons. Compared with the experimental data collected using a motion capture system, the values of RMSE and HPDI of the generated wrist trajectory in the task space are within 0.2 and 0.17, respectively, while those of RMSE in the joint space are within 15 deg, which demonstrates the human-like nature of the generated motion.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Although several previous studies on laterality of upper limb motor control have reported functional differences, this conclusion has not been agreed upon. It may be conjectured that the inconsistent results were caused because upper limb motor control was observed in multi-joint tasks that could generate different inter-joint motor coordination for each arm. Resolving this, we employed a single wrist joint tracking task to reduce the effect of multi-joint dynamics and examined the differences between the dominant and non-dominant hands in terms of motor control. Specifically, we defined two sections to induce feedback (FB) and feedforward (FF) controls: the first section involved a visible target for FB control, and the other section involved an invisible target for FF control. We examined the differences in the position errors of the tracer and the target. Fourteen healthy participants performed the task. As a result, we found that during FB control, the dominant hand performed better than the non-dominant hand, while we did not observe significant differences in FF control. In other words, in a single-joint movement that is not under the influence of the multi-joint coordination, only FB control showed laterality and not FF control. Furthermore, we confirmed that the dominant hand outperformed the non-dominant hand in terms of responding to situations that required a change in control strategy. © 2023 by the authors.},

To this end, we firstly develop a kinematic model to describe the control variables and the various postures of the soft robotic hand. Based on the postural synergies, we use the developed model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to describe the various postures of the soft robotic hand in a low-dimensional space formed by the synergies of actuator motions. Therefore, the coordinates of these synergies can be used as low-dimensional control inputs for the soft robotic hand with a higher-dimensional postural space. Finally, we establish an experimental platform on a customized soft robotic hand with 6 pneumatical actuators to verify the effectiveness of the development. Experimental results demonstrate that with only a 2-dimensional control input, the soft robotic hand can reliably replicate 30 grasp postures in the Feix taxonomy of the human hand. © 2022, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Reaching for an object in space forms the basis for many activities of daily living and is important in rehabilitation after stroke and in other neurological and orthopedic conditions. It has been the object of motor control and neuroscience research for over a century, but studies often constrain movement to eliminate the effect of gravity or reduce the degrees of freedom. In some studies, aging has been shown to reduce target accuracy, with a mechanism suggested to be impaired corrective movements. We sought to explore how such changes in accuracy relate to changes in finger, shoulder and elbow movements during performance of reaching movements with the normal effects of gravity, unconstrained hand movement, and stable target locations. Three-dimensional kinematic data and electromyography were collected in 14 young (25 ± 6 years) and 10 older adults (68 ± 3 years) during second-long reaches to 3 targets aligned vertically in front of the participants. Older adults took longer to initiate a movement than the young adults and were more variable and inaccurate in their initial and final movements. Target height had greater effect on trajectory curvature variability in older than young adults, with angle variability relative to target position being greater in older adults around the time of peak speed. There were significant age-related differences in use of the multiple degrees of freedom of the upper extremity, with less variability in shoulder abduction in the older group. Muscle activation patterns were similar, except for a higher biceps-triceps co-contraction and tonic levels of some proximal muscle activation. These results show an age-related deficit in the motor planning and online correction of reaching movements against a predictable force (i.e., gravity) when it is not compensated by mechanical support. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

	abstract = {There have been significant advances in biosignal extraction techniques to drive external biomechatronic devices or to use as inputs to sophisticated human machine interfaces. The control signals are typically derived from biological signals such as myoelectric measurements made either from the surface of the skin or subcutaneously. Other biosignal sensing modalities are emerging. With improvements in sensing modalities and control algorithms, it is becoming possible to robustly control the target position of an end-effector. It remains largely unknown to what extent these improvements can lead to naturalistic human-like movement. In this paper, we sought to answer this question. We utilized a sensing paradigm called sonomyography based on continuous ultrasound imaging of forearm muscles. Unlike myoelectric control strategies which measure electrical activation and use the extracted signals to determine the velocity of an end-effector; sonomyography measures muscle deformation directly with ultrasound and uses the extracted signals to proportionally control the position of an end-effector. Previously, we showed that users were able to accurately and precisely perform a virtual target acquisition task using sonomyography. In this work, we investigate the time course of the control trajectories derived from sonomyography. We show that the time course of the sonomyography-derived trajectories that users take to reach virtual targets reflect the trajectories shown to be typical for kinematic characteristics observed in biological limbs. Specifically, during a target acquisition task, the velocity profiles followed a minimum jerk trajectory shown for point-to-point arm reaching movements, with similar time to target. In addition, the trajectories based on ultrasound imaging result in a systematic delay and scaling of peak movement velocity as the movement distance increased. We believe this is the first evaluation of similarities in control policies in coordinated movements in jointed limbs, and those based on position control signals extracted at the individual muscle level. These results have strong implications for the future development of control paradigms for assistive technologies. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

In cobots, one under-investigated but important issue is related to their movement and how it is perceived by humans. This paper tries to analyze whether humans prefer a robot moving in a human or in a robotic fashion. To this end, the present work lays out what differentiates the movement performed by an industrial robotic arm from that performed by a human one. The main difference lies in the fact that the robotic movement has a trapezoidal speed profile, while for the human arm, the speed profile is bell-shaped and during complex movements, it can be considered as a sum of superimposed bell-shaped movements. Based on the lognormality principle, a procedure was developed for a robotic arm to perform human-like movements. Both speed profiles were implemented in two industrial robots, namely, an ABB IRB 120 and a Universal Robot UR3. Three tests were used to study the subjects’ preference when seeing both movements and another analyzed the same when interacting with the robot by touching its ends with their fingers. © 2022 by the authors.},

Bionic structures and human-like control strategies can be used to enhance both the safety and efficacy of exoskeletons. However, the motion characteristics of the shoulder complex are not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we designed a 7-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) upper limb rehabilitation exoskeleton, FREE (functional rehabilitation exoskeleton). The mechanical structures of the shoulder and forearm of FREE are in accordance with human anatomy, and can be used to perform a wide range of synergistic motion of multiple joints while keeping a safe distance from the patient’s head. A multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) shoulder girdle motion prediction model was developed to satisfy the synergy between humans and exoskeletons. Moreover, a constrained task priority and projected gradient-based inverse kinematics algorithm (CTPPG-IK) was proposed to achieve assistance with scapulohumeral rhythm. A motion capture system was used to collect different activities of daily life (ADL) motion data to validate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the prediction model is higher than that of existing models, and the inverse kinematics algorithm can handle the end-effector task and joint space with a maximum angle error of (Formula presented.) rad. © 2023 by the authors.},

To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-task planning algorithm for human-like arm motion based on the energy principle and the joint limit avoidance principle. First, a motion capture device is used to collect human arm motion data to obtain guidelines for human arm motion characteristics. On the basis of analyzing the arm demonstration data, the gravitational potential energy and virtual elastic potential energy models of the arm are established, and the mapping from the virtual variable stiffness of the arm to the virtual variable stiffness of the robot is realized. An end-effector trajectory is generated based on a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) model and an optimization method, while a spherical linear interpolation (slerp) algorithm is used to generate the attitude sequence. In order to better execute the planned motion, the priority of the motion task is divided, and the design of two priority motion tasks is carried out by combining the gradient projection method. Finally, the humanoid arm motion multi-task planning algorithm proposed in this paper is simulated by simulation experiments, and the experimental results show that the method can generate the corresponding humanoid motions and has better motion accuracy.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are often designed to produce nonverbal behavior to complement or enhance their verbal communication. One such form of the nonverbal behavior is co-speech gesturing, which involves movements that the agent makes with its arms and hands that are paired with verbal communication. Co-speech gestures for ECAs can be created using different generation methods, divided into rule-based and data-driven processes, with the latter, gaining traction because of the increasing interest from the applied machine learning community. However, reports on gesture generation methods use a variety of evaluation measures, which hinders comparison. To address this, we present a systematic review on co-speech gesture generation methods for iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat gestures, including reported evaluation methods. We review 22 studies that have an ECA with a human-like upper body that uses co-speech gesturing in social human-agent interaction. This includes studies that use human participants to evaluate performance. We found most studies use a within-subject design and rely on a form of subjective evaluation, but without a systematic approach. We argue that the field requires more rigorous and uniform tools for co-speech gesture evaluation, and formulate recommendations for empirical evaluation, including standardized phrases and example scenarios to help systematically test generative models across studies. Furthermore, we also propose a checklist that can be used to report relevant information for the evaluation of generative models, as well as to evaluate co-speech gesture use.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Anthropomorphism of artificial systems is a key enabling factor to ensure effective and compelling human–machine interactions in different domains, including immersive extended reality environments and cobotics applications. Among the different aspects that anthropomorphism refers to, the generation of human-like motions plays a crucial role. To this aim, optimization-based techniques, whose functional cost is devised from neuroscientific findings, or learning-based approaches have been proposed in literature. However, these methods come with limitations, e.g., limited motion variability or the need for high dimensional datasets. In previous works of our group, we proposed to exploit functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) of human upper limb movements, to extract principal motion modes in the joint domain and use them to directly embed the human-like behaviour in the planning algorithm. However, this approach faces with translational issues related to the computational burden and to the application to kinematic structures different from the one used to describe human movements. To overcome this problem, we propose a general framework to generate human-like motion directly in the Cartesian domain by exploiting fPCA. This solution permits to perform obstacle avoidance with low computational time and it can be applied to any kinematic chain. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we tested it against a state-of-the-art human-like planning algorithm both in terms of the accuracy of target reaching and human-likeness features of the generated movement. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Outstanding examples are the adoption of soft covers, compliant transmission elements, and motion control laws that allow compliant behavior in the event of collisions while preserving accuracy and performance during motion in free space. In this scenario, there is growing interest in variable stiffness actuators (VSAs). Herein, we present a new design of an anthropomorphic elbow VSA based on an architecture we developed previously. A robust dynamic feedback linearization algorithm is used to achieve simultaneous control of the output link position and stiffness. This actuation system makes use of two compliant transmission elements, characterized by a nonlinear relation between deflection and applied torque. Static feedback control algorithms have been proposed in literature considering purely elastic transmission; however, viscoelasticity is often observed in practice. This phenomenon may harm the performance of static feedback linearization algorithms, particularly in the case of trajectory tracking. To overcome this limitation, we propose a dynamic feedback linearization algorithm that explicitly considers the viscoelasticity of the transmission elements, and validate it through simulations and experimental studies. The results are compared with the static feedback case to showcase the improvement in trajectory tracking, even in the case of parameter uncertainty. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Their use in task-dependent robot teaching - particularly their transfer from a teacher to a learner - can advance emulation of human-like motion. Although in recent literature focus is shifted towards manipulability transfer between two robots, the adaptation to the capabilities of the other kinematic system is to date not addressed and research in transfer from human to robot is still in its infancy. This work presents a novel manipulability domain adaptation method for the transfer of manipulability information to the domain of another kinematic system. As manipulability matrices/ellipsoids are symmetric positive-definite (SPD) they can be viewed as points on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices. We are the first to address the problem of manipulability transfer from the perspective of point cloud registration. We propose a manifold-aware Iterative Closest Point algorithm (ICP) with parallel transport initialization. Furthermore, we introduce a correspondence matching heuristic for manipulability ellipsoids based on inherent geometric features. We confirm our method in simulation experiments with 2-DoF manipulators as well as 7-DoF models representing the human-arm kinematics. © 2022 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a dual arm coordination algorithm to improve the efficiency of coordination by considering both robot's actions and operating sequences of the tasks that need to use two arms to complete complex operations. Teleoperation demonstration is first performed to obtain the robot's human-like motion trajectories, so as to reduce the probability of the collisions between the two arms. The coordination diagram in time domain is then designed to more clearly represent the situations of trajectory collisions and find the collision-free coordination action law. A Coordination Pair Generator (CPG) is designed to reorganize the operating sequences according to the characteristics of input trajectories and the action coordination. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are verified on the simulation and physical experiments which execute the drug sorting task in nursing homes, respectively, on the ABB YuMi robot model and self-developed robot system.

	abstract = {This study examines a biology-inspired approach of using reconfigurable articulation to reduce the control requirement for soft robotic arms. We construct a robotic arm by assembling Kresling origami modules that exhibit predictable bistability. By switching between their two stable states, these origami modules can behave either like a flexible joint with low bending stiffness or like a stiff link with high stiffness, without requiring any continuous power supply. In this way, the robotic arm can exhibit pseudo-linkage kinematics with lower control requirements and improved motion accuracy. A unique advantage of using origami as the robotic arm skeleton is that its bending stiffness ratio between stable states is directly related to the underlying Kresling design. Therefore, we conduct extensive parametric analyses and experimental validations to identify the optimized Kresling pattern for articulation. The results indicate that a higher angle ratio, a smaller resting length at contracted stable state, and a large number of polygon sides can offer more significant and robust bending stiffness tuning. Based on this insight, we construct a proof-of-concept, tendon-driven robotic arm consisting of three modules and show that it can exhibit the desired reconfigurable articulation behavior. Moreover, the deformations of this manipulator are consistent with kinematic model predictions, which validate the possibility of using simple controllers for such compliant robotic systems.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.},

	abstract = {Dexterous manipulation, particularly adept coordinating and grasping, constitutes a fundamental and indispensable capability for robots, facilitating the emulation of human-like behaviors. Integrating this capability into robots empowers them to supplement and even supplant humans in undertaking increasingly intricate tasks in both daily life and industrial settings. Unfortunately, contemporary methodologies encounter serious challenges in devising manipulation trajectories owing to the intricacies of tasks, the expansive robotic manipulation space, and dynamic obstacles. We propose a novel approach, APEX, to address all these difficulties by introducing a collision-free latent diffusion model for both robotic motion planning and manipulation. Firstly, we simplify the complexity of real-life ambidextrous dual-arm robotic manipulation tasks by abstracting them as aligning two vectors. Secondly, we devise latent diffusion models to produce a variety of robotic manipulation trajectories. Furthermore, we integrate obstacle information utilizing a classifier-guidance technique, thereby guaranteeing both the feasibility and safety of the generated manipulation trajectories. Lastly, we validate our proposed algorithm through extensive experiments conducted on the hardware platform of ambidextrous dual-arm robots. Our algorithm consistently generates successful and seamless trajectories across diverse tasks, surpassing conventional robotic motion planning algorithms. These results carry significant implications for the future design of diffusion robots, enhancing their capability to tackle more intricate robotic manipulation tasks with increased efficiency and safety.

	abstract = {Industrial applications with robotic manipulators have grown and made production systems increasingly efficient. However, there are still some limitations that can delay production, causing losses. Several factors, such as accidents and collisions of manipulator robots with operators and other machines, can cause unforeseen stops. Thus, this work aims to develop a trajectory planning method to avoid collisions applied to a selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA) robotic manipulator in the context of collaborative robotics. The main contribution of this paper is a path planning method based on mathematical morphology, named topological path planning (TPP). Through some evaluation metrics such as the number of path points, computing time, distance, standard deviation of the joint acceleration, and maximum acceleration rate along the path, we show that TPP is a collision-free, deterministic, and predictable route planning. In our experiments, our proposal presented better results for applications in industrial robotic manipulators when compared to the probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) and TPP*, a particular case of TPP that is similar to the generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD). © 2023 by the authors.},

On average, the computation time of our approach is below 2 seconds, and its average success rate is around 70 %. The computation time of the proposed planner significantly improves that of the state-of-the-art planner by roughly a factor of 20, making the former suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, for application domains where the obstacle motion is not very predictable (e.g., human obstacles), the proposed planner significantly improves the success rate of state-of-the-art planners by nearly 50 %.

	abstract = {Admittance control of the robot is an important method to improve human-robot collaborative performance. However, it displays poor matching between admittance parameters and human-robot collaborative motion. This results in poor motion performance when the robot interacts with the changeable environment (human). Therefore, to improve the performance of human-robot collaboration, the human-like variable admittance parameter regulator (HVAPR) based on the change rate of interaction force is proposed by studying the human arm's static and dynamic admittance parameters in human-human collaborative motion. HVAPR can generate admittance parameters matching with human collaborative motion. To test the performance of the proposed HVAPR, the human-robot collaborative motion experiment based on HVAPR is designed and compared with the variable admittance parameter regulator (VAPR). The satisfaction, recognition ratio, and recognition confidence of the two admittance parameter regulators are statistically analyzed via questionnaire. Simultaneously, the trajectory and interaction force of the robot are analyzed, and the performance of the human-robot collaborative motion is assessed and compared using the trajectory smoothness index and average energy index. The results show that HVAPR is superior to VAPR in human-robot collaborative satisfaction, robot trajectory smoothness, and average energy consumption. © The Author(s), 2023.

	abstract = {High-speed and high-acceleration movements are inherently hard to control. Applying learning to the control of such motions on anthropomorphic robot arms can improve the control's accuracy but might damage the system. The inherent exploration of learning approaches can lead to instabilities and the robot reaching joint limits at high speeds. Having hardware that enables safe exploration of high-speed and high-acceleration movements is therefore desirable. To address this issue, we propose to use robots actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). In this paper, we present a four degrees of freedom (DoFs) robot arm that reaches high joint angle accelerations of up to 28000°s-2 while avoiding dangerous joint limits thanks to the antagonistic actuation and limits on the air pressure ranges. With this robot arm, we can tune control parameters using Bayesian optimization directly on the hardware without additional safety considerations. The achieved tracking performance on a fast trajectory exceeds previous results on comparable PAM-driven robots. We also show that our system can be controlled well on slow trajectories with PID controllers due to careful construction considerations such as minimal bending of cables, lightweight kinematics, and minimal contact between PAMs and PAMs with the links. Finally, we propose a novel technique to control the co-contraction of antagonistic muscle pairs. Experimental results illustrate that choosing the optimal co-contraction level is vital to reach better tracking performance. Using PAM-driven robots and learning, we do a small step towards the future development of robots capable of more human-like motions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

An Intelligent Human-like Motion Planner (IHMP) consisting of Movement Primitive (MP), Bayesian Network (BN) and Coupling Neural Network (CPNN) is proposed to help the robot generate human-like arm movements. Firstly, the arm motion model is decoupled in the aspects of arm structure and motion process, respectively. In the former aspect, the arm model is decoupled into different simple models through the Movement Primitive. A Hierarchical Planning Strategy (HPS) is proposed to decouple a complete motion process into different sub-processes. Based on diversified arm motion models, the Bayesian Network is used to help the robot choose the suitable motion model among these arm motion models. Then, according to the features of diversified arm motion models, the Coupling Neural Network is proposed to obtain the inverse kinematic (IK) solutions. This network can integrate different models into a single network and reflect the features of these models by changing the network structure. Being a major contribution to this paper, specific focus is on the improvement of human-like motion accuracy and independent consciousness of robots. Finally, the availability of the IHMP is verified by experiments on a humanoid robot Pepper. © 2023 by the author.},

This algorithm facilitates finding a desirable solution easily and with less calculation cost compared to analytical and numerical methods, the thing that allows achieving realistic and efficient motion. This algorithm maintains balance between exploring new options and using current knowledge. Newton-Euler recursive approach is used for determining the robots dynamic properties. Then the required actuators are chosen, and stress analysis is conducted to evaluate the structural integrity of the robot and its capacity to withstand substantial loads. Adjustable backstepping fuzzy control method is used that is more robust to uncertainties, nonlinearities, and external disturbances and offers the robot the ability to perform movement in space, cooperate, and complete tasks in a coordinated manner. Ellipsoid intersection localizing method is used for collision avoidance. The selected methods excel at predicting the joints’ movements required to attain desired poses with great accuracy and avoid collision.

	abstract = {Replicating natural postures of human arms is essential to generate human-like behaviors in robotic applications for humans nearby. However, how to realize this requirement in interactive scenarios remains a challenge due to the kinematic redundancy and unknown postural control strategy of human arms. Inspired by the physiological characteristics that the musculoskeletal system is coordinated to minimize muscle effort in human behaviors, this paper aims to address the issue by solving a muscle effort minimization problem. It adopts a high-fidelity human arm musculoskeletal model (HAMM) and considers the implicit constraint (desired hand pose) and the inequality constraints (range of joint motion). The constrained minimization is in general nonconvex, consequently sensitive to initial guesses in iterative procedures. So, it is impracticable to solve it directly with existing gradient-based deterministic approaches or standard evolutionary algorithms. As the main contribution, a hybrid inverse kinematics algorithm was proposed for the HAMM with 7 independent and 13 mimic joints to obtain the feasible arm postures satisfying the minimization constraints. Using the arm swivel angle that parametrizes the kinematic redundancy of the HAMM, geometrically equidistant initial guess candidates can be generated over the 1-dimension feasible posture manifold. As another contribution, we present a two-phase global minimization algorithm to handle the nonconvexity of the constrained minimization. It consists of a local-search phase on the null-space of the geometric Jacobian matrix and a global-search phase with an initial guess resampling strategy. The proposed approach was validated by replicating the natural arm postures of 5 right-handed subjects in daily tasks.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The teleoperation of robots with human-like capabilities may pose significant challenges to the human operator due to the kinematic complexity and redundancy of these robots. Bimanual telemanipulation represents such a challenging task that requires precise coordination of the two arms to perform a stable bimanual grasp on an object and eventually transport the object while maintaining the grasp. In this work, we present a shared control telemanipulation interface to facilitate the bimanual grasping and transportation of objects of unknown mass. With the proposed method, the robot is able to transport the object maintaining autonomously a sufficient amount of grasping force while accepting commands from the operator to reach the desired location. As humans do, it is not necessary to know the weight of the object in advance; instead, the robot estimates it during the lifting phase. On the basis of the estimated weight, the required amount of grasping force is computed. During object transportation, the robot autonomously regulates the grasping forces in a shared control fashion, allowing the operator to seamlessly command only the trajectories of the object. The proposed method has been implemented and validated on the CENTAURO robot, a quadrupedal platform with a humanoid dual arm upper body, performing experiment where objects of different weights and dimensions must be picked up and transported. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for generating fast, smooth and predictable braking manoeuvers for a controlled robot. The proposed framework integrates two approaches to obtain feasible modal limits for designing braking trajectories. The first approach is real-time capable but conservative considering the usage of the available feasible actuator control region, resulting in longer braking times. In contrast, the second approach maximizes the used braking control inputs at the cost of requiring more time to evaluate larger, feasible modal limits via optimization. Both approaches allow for predicting the robot's stopping trajectory online. In addition, we also formulated and solved a constrained, nonlinear final-time minimization problem to find optimal torque inputs. The optimal solutions were used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictable braking framework. A comparative study was compiled in simulation versus a classical optimal controller on a 7-DoF robot arm with only three moving joints. The results verified the effectiveness of our proposed framework and its integrated approaches in achieving fast robot braking manoeuvers with accurate online predictions of the stopping trajectories and distances under various braking settings.

We present a new reactive motion controller that commands two arms of a humanoid robot and three torso joints (17 DoF in total). We formulate a quadratic program that seeks joint velocity commands respecting multiple constraints while minimizing the magnitude of the velocities. We introduce a new unified treatment of obstacles that dynamically maps visual and proximity (pre-collision) and tactile (post-collision) obstacles as additional constraints to the motion controller, in a distributed fashion over surface of the upper body of the iCub robot (with 2000 pressure-sensitive receptors). This results in a bio-inspired controller that: (i) gives rise to a robot with whole-body visuo-tactile awareness, resembling peripersonal space representations, and (ii) produces human- like minimum jerk movement profiles. The controller was extensively experimentally validated, including a physical human-robot interaction scenario.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Building humanoid robots with properties similar to those of humans in terms of strength, agility, and motion versatility remains a challenge. To achieve human-like motion behavior, an identification of the actuation requirements is crucial. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically calculates the necessary actuator requirements for a given upper-body humanoid robot kinematics performing motions retargeted from human motion data. First, we introduce a unified representation of humanoid upper limb kinematics to decouple the analysis from robot-specific features to allow the comparison between different humanoid robot kinematics. Second, we derive a novel performance index to compare actuator requirements regarding velocity, acceleration, and torque for different kinematics, which are needed for the execution of retargeted human motions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the calculated actuator requirements and performance indices of ten existing humanoid robot kinematics in addition to a new robot design, using 40 recorded human motions of different categories. The results demonstrate the impact of robot kinematics on the joint actuator requirements for achieving human-like motion. © 2023 IEEE.},

The task of reinterpreting calligraphy presents a formidable challenge, as it involves the decomposition of strokes and dexterous utensil control. Previous efforts have primarily focused on supervised learning of a single instrument, limiting the performance of robots in the realm of cross-domain text replication. To address these challenges, we propose CalliRewrite: a coarse-to-fine approach for robot arms to discover and recover plausible writing orders from diverse calligraphy images without requiring labeled demonstrations. Our model achieves fine-grained control of various writing utensils. Specifically, an unsupervised image-to-sequence model decomposes a given calligraphy glyph to obtain a coarse stroke sequence. Using an RL algorithm, a simulated brush is fine-tuned to generate stylized trajectories for robotic arm control. Evaluation in simulation and physical robot scenarios reveals that our method successfully replicates unseen fonts and styles while achieving integrity in unknown characters.

	abstract = {In human-robot collaboration, legible intent of the robot is critical to success as it enables the human to more effectively work with and around the robot. Environments where humans and robots collaborate are widely varied and in the real world are most often cluttered. However, prior work in legible motion utilizes primarily environments which are uncluttered. Success in these environments does not necessarily guarantee success in more cluttered environments. Furthermore, the prior work has been primarily performed based on results from robot-human studies and the problem has not been studied from the prospective of what people do to express intent to each other. Therefore, this work addresses a gap in current research into legible robot arm motion in the following ways: first we perform a human-human study in order to establish the factors which humans use to express their intent through body language, and second we perform the study in a cluttered and varied environment. Through the study we showed that the primary factors which people considered are: timing, kinematic parameters, hand gestures, object proximity, etc. The results also showed that legibility is correlated with perceived safety, perceived social intelligence, the collaborator's contribution, and trust which further speaks to the importance of legible motion. Future work will utilize the pose data extracted from the study's video recordings to develop a model for legible motion.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Humanoid robots are expected to have broad applications due to their biped mobility and human-like shape. To increase the walking speed, it is necessary to increase the power for driving the joints of legs. However, the resulting mass increasing of the legs leads to a rotational slip when a robot is walking fast. In this paper, a 3D three-mass model is proposed, in which both the trunk and thighs are regarded as an inverted pendulum, and the shanks and feet are considered as mass-points under no constraints with the trunk. Then based on the model, a friction constraint method is proposed to plan the trajectory of the swing leg in order to achieve the fastest walking speed without any rotational slip. Furthermore, the compensation for zero-moment point (ZMP) is calculated based on the 3D three-mass model, and the hip trajectory is obtained based on the compensated ZMP trajectory by using the preview control method, thus improving the robot's overall ZMP follow-up effect. This planning method involves simple calculations but reliable results. Finally, simulations confirm that the rotational slip is avoided while stable and fast walking is realized, with free joints of the waist and arms, which then could be planned for other tasks. © 2019 by the authors.},

Designing soft body anthropomorphic robotic hands with human-like grasping ability, but with a simple and reliable structure, is a challenge that still has not been not fully solved. In this paper, we present an anatomically correct robotic hand 3D model that aims to realize the human hand’s functionality using a single type of 3D-printable material. Our robotic hand 3D model is combined with bones, ligaments, tendons, pulley systems, and tissue. We also describe the fabrication method to rapidly produce our robotic hand in 3D printing, wherein all parts are made by elastic 50 A (shore durometer) resin. In the experimental section, we show that our robotic hand has a similar motion range to a human hand with substantial grasping strength and compare it with the latest other designs of anthropomorphic robotic hands. Our new design greatly reduces the fabrication cost and assembly time. Compared with other robotic hand designs, we think our robotic hand may induce a new approach to the design and production of robotic hands as well as other related mechanical structures. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to introduce the human arm movement primitive (HAMP) to express and plan the motions of anthropomorphic arms. The task planning method is established for the minimum task cost and a novel human-like motion planning method based on the HAMPs is proposed to help humans better understand and plan the motions of anthropomorphic arms. Design/methodology/approach: The HAMPs are extracted based on the structure and motion expression of the human arm. A method to slice the complex tasks into simple subtasks and sort subtasks is proposed. Then, a novel human-like motion planning method is built through the selection, sequencing and quantification of HAMPs. Finally, the HAMPs are mapped to the traditional joint angles of a robot by an analytical inverse kinematics method to control the anthropomorphic arms. Findings: For the exploration of the motion laws of the human arm, the human arm motion capture experiments on 12 subjects are performed. The results show that the motion laws of human arm are reflected in the selection, sequencing and quantification of HAMPs. These motion laws can facilitate the human-like motion planning of anthropomorphic arms. Originality/value: This study presents the HAMPs and a method for selecting, sequencing and quantifying them in human-like style, which leads to a new motion planning method for the anthropomorphic arms. A similar methodology is suitable for robots with anthropomorphic arms such as service robots, upper extremity exoskeleton robots and humanoid robots. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {LiDARs can capture distances with high accuracy and should be very useful to create point clouds that provide highly detailed representations of an environment. If these reconstructions are meant as baseline or ground truth for other algorithms, they must have a high density and accuracy. Currently available LiDARs do still face some limitations. Either they have a limited range, or they have a rather limited resolution in one or more dimensions. As a consequence, all of them have to undergo motion to capture a larger environment. While some systems follow extremely well-predictable motion paths such as satellite trajectories or robotic arms, others require more spontaneous and flexible motion. These systems use either visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM), GPS or IMU to achieve this, but they are generally designed in such a way that human intervention is required during the creation of high-quality point clouds. In this paper, we make use of a rotating LiDAR with an attached IMU to create dense point clouds of room-scale environments with the base accuracy of the LiDAR by compensating for the various inaccuracies that are introduced by the LiDAR's motion. The resulting dense scans are suitable as ground truths for other techniques because we retain the error distribution of the LiDAR itself through the densification. In contrast to other works, we do not aim at a visually pleasing or easily meshable result and we can therefore avoid potentially inaccurate assumptions about the flatness of surfaces. We take a two-step approach. First, we densify from a stationary position changing only the LiDAR's pitch. Second, we add free motion to expose obstructed views. We show that motion paths determined by repeated Iterative Closest Point (ICP) as well as image matching on height maps can be used to create feasible priors for densification using ICP. © 2020 ACM.},

Up to now, a robotic arm on an assembly line interacts with other machines away from human workers. Nowadays, robotic arm manufactures are aimed to their robots could increasingly perform tasks collaborating with humans. One of the ways to improve this collaboration is by making the movement of robots more humanlike. This way, it would be easier for a human to foresee the movement of the robot and approach it without fear of contact. The main difference between the movement of a human and of a robotic arm is that the former has a bell-shaped speed profile while the latter has a uniform speed one. To generate this speed profile, the kinematic theory of rapid human movements and its Sigma-Lognormal model has been used. This model is widely used to explain most of the basic phenomena related to the control of human movements. Both human-like and robotic-like movements are transferred to the UR3 robot. In this paper we detail the how the UR3 robot was programmed to produce both kinds of movement. The dissimilarities result between the input motion and output motion to the robot confirm the possibility to develop humanlike velocities in the UR3 robot. © 2021 IEEE.},

Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) and Passive Motion Paradigm (PMP) are currently two leading theories capable of effectively producing human-like motions, but they require solving nonlinear inverse problems to find a solution. The main benefit of using PMP is the possibility of generating path-independent movements consistent with the stereotypical behaviour observed in humans, while the equivalent OFC formulation is path-dependent. Our results demonstrate how the path-independent behaviour observed for the wrist pointing task can be explained by spherical projections of the planar tasks. The combination of the projections with the fractal impedance controller eliminates the nonlinear inverse problem, which reduces the computational cost compared to previous methodologies. The motion exploits a recently proposed PMP architecture that replaces the nonlinear inverse optimisation with a nonlinear anisotropic stiffness impedance profile generated by the Fractal Impedance Controller, reducing the computational cost and not requiring a task-dependent optimisation. © 2021 IEEE.},

The robot has achieved walking motion to attach Hubo's lower body. Also, it needs arm motions to interact with people such as a handshake and gestures. To handshake with a person, we use inverse kinematics (IK) of Sophia-Hubo's right arm for stretching the arm to the person and torque control for handshaking. We use Levenberg-Marquardt method with Robust Damping to find a solution of the IK, and torque control of Dynamixel on shoulder pitch and elbow joint. The torque control input is calculated with the measured joint angular velocity. For making joints moving smoothly, we apply a 5th polynomial function trajectory. Through recursively adding the 5th polynomial trajectory to the end of the previous trajectory, we can make gestures. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Full-dimensional natural arm manipulation is a challenging task in the field of model-based control due to its high degree of freedom and unknown dynamics of the given system. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for handling high-dimensional robotics problems. Although impressive results for the arm manipulation task have been reported, it still remains an open problem on how we can create human-like synergetic reaching motion using learning algorithms. In this study, we apply DRL for managing full-dimensional arm manipulation in a simulation study, and verify the relations among motion error, energy, and synergy emergence, to reveal the mechanism of employing motor synergy. Although synergy information has never been encoded into the reward function, the synergy naturally emerges along with feedforward control, leading to a similar situation as human motion learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer study demonstrating the error and energy optimization issue exists behind the motor synergy employment in DRL for reaching tasks. In addition, our proposed feedback-augmented DRL controller shows better capability over DRL in terms of synergy development and the coupled criteria of error-energy index. This implies that feedback control can support the learning process under redundancy by voiding unnecessary random exploration.  © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A variable stiffness actuator is inspired by the human motor control and is the most popular actuator used to exploit the human performance and human-like motion. However, these actuators are typically highly non-linear and redundant not only in their kinematics but also in their dynamics due to their capability to modulate their stiffness and positions simultaneously. It is not trivial to generate the trajectory for a strongly non-linear and redundant dynamic system equipped with variable stiffness actuators. In this paper, a trajectory planning method for a variable stiffness actuated robot via a time-energy optimal control policy is proposed. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the trajectory planning method through the case studies of a two degree of freedom variable stiffness actuated robot. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed method could be able to generate the motion which is similar to the human arm motion strategy. © 2019 IEEE.},

On one hand, a small footprint is required while maintaining a fixed arm configuration, to make robot motion predictable for near individuals during the long traverse. On the other hand, redundancy resolution poses a challenge since there is no direct kinematic mapping between the task and joint spaces for SWMR. Hence, we propose a redundancy resolution algorithm that enables switching between 3 modes of operation based on the Euclidean norm of the motion task error. In particular, we employ a floating base model for the mobile platform, and enhance the end effector motion performance by predicting the error between such model and the actual (SWMR) one. Such error is then compensated using the highly responsive arm manipulator. The proposed methodology is successfully validated in simulations on a Neobotix-MPO700 SWMR with a Kuka LWR-IV manipulator mounted on it. © 2019 IEEE.},

Here, we formulate and study computationally the hypothesis that such patterns can emerge spontaneously as the result of a family of stochastic optimization processes, without an innate encoding of a maturational schedule. In particular, we present simulated experiments with an arm where a computational learner progressively acquires reaching skills through adaptive exploration, and we show that a proximodistal organization appears spontaneously, which we denote PDFF (Proximo Distal Freezing and Freeing of degrees of freedom). We also compare this emergent organization between different arm morphologies—from human-like to quite unnatural ones—to study the effect of different kinematic structures on the emergence of PDFF. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Human-likeliness of robot movements is a key component to enable a safe and effective human-robot interaction, since it contributes to increase acceptance and motion predictability of robots that have to closely interact with people, e.g. for assistance and rehabilitation purposes. Several parameters have been used to quantify how much a robot behaves like a human, which encompass aspects related to both the robot appearance and motion. The latter point is fundamental to allow the operator to interpret robotic actions, and plan a meaningful reactions. While different approaches have been presented in literature, which aim at devising bio-aware control guidelines, a direct implementation of human actions for robot planning is not straightforward, still representing an open issue in robotics. Methods: We propose to embed a synergistic representation of human movements for robot motion generation. To do this, we recorded human upper-limb motions during daily living activities. We used functional Principal Component Analysis (fPCA) to extract principal motion patterns. We then formulated the planning problem by optimizing the weights of a reduced set of these components. For free-motions, our planning method results into a closed form solution which uses only one principal component. In case of obstacles, a numerical routine is proposed, incrementally enrolling principal components until the problem is solved with a suitable precision. Results: Results of fPCA show that more than 80% of the observed variance can be explained by only three functional components. The application of our method to different meaningful movements, with and without obstacles, show that our approach is able to generate complex motions with a very reduced number of functional components. We show that the first synergy alone accounts for the 96% of cost reduction and that three components are able to achieve a satisfactory motion reconstruction in all the considered cases. Conclusions: In this work we moved from the analysis of human movements via fPCA characterization to the design of a novel human-like motion generation algorithm able to generate, efficiently and with a reduced set of basis elements, several complex movements in free space, both in free motion and in case of obstacle avoidance tasks. © 2020 The Author(s).},

The basic hypothesis is that in human handshaking force control there is a balance between an intrinsic (open-loop) and extrinsic (closed-loop) contributions. We use an underactuated anthropomorphic robotic hand, the Pisa/IIT hand, instrumented with a set of pressure sensors estimating the grip force applied by humans. In a first set of experiments, we ask subjects to mimic a given force profile applied by the robot hand, to understand how human perceive and are able to reproduce a handshaking force. Using the obtained results, we implement three different handshaking controllers, in which we varied the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions and in a second set of experiments, we ask participants to evaluate them in a user study. We show that a sensorimotor delay mimicking the reaction time of the central nervous system is beneficial for making interactions more human-like. Moreover, we demonstrate that humans exploit closed-loop control for handshaking. By varying the controller we show that we can change the perceived handshake quality and also influence personality traits attributed to the robot. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this paper we describe the implementation of a simple robotic arm capable of moving and lift some objects. The development of this arm is based on the Arduino UNO. The servos act as joints of the robotic arm which are controlled by corresponding potentiometer. We have used low torque servos here due to budget constraint and proof of concept; however more powerful servos can be integrated to pick heavy object. This particular robotic arm was designed with four degrees of freedom and programmed to accurately accomplish simple and light material lifting task as in the production line in any industry. However, it can be used as pharmacy-based drug-giving robots; in the medical sector and in automation systems. The generation of the human-like manipulation motions has been implemented and also tested successfully for the 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) arm of the humanoid robot. The presented approach does not consider the dynamics of the robot arm. This would be necessary to generate realistic velocity distribution for the manipulation motions. The implemented prototype has the ability to move in 4 axis directions with 4 servo motors. The voltage across variable resistors is not completely linear rather a noisy one. Capacitors are used across each resistor to filter out this noise, as shown in figure 1. This voltage represents the control position and is fed into four ADC channels of Arduino to get corresponding digital values. The Arduino UNO ADC has a resolution of 10 bit, means it maps input voltages between 0 and 5V into digital values between 0 and 1023; in other words, 4.9mV per unit.

	abstract = {Humans typically fixate on objects before moving their arm to grasp the object. Patients with ALS disorder can also select the object with their intact eye movement, but are unable to move their limb due to the loss of voluntary muscle control. Though several research works have already achieved success in generating the correct grasp type from their brain measurement, we are still searching for fine controll over an object with a grasp assistive device (orthosis/exoskeleton/robotic arm). Object orientation and object width are two important parameters for controlling the wrist angle and the grasp aperture of the assistive device to replicate a human-like stable grasp. Vision systems are already evolved to measure the geometrical attributes of the object to control the grasp with a prosthetic hand. However, most of the existing vision systems are integrated with electromyography and require some amount of voluntary muscle movement to control the vision system. Due to that reason, those systems are not beneficial for the users with brain-controlled assistive devices. Here, we implemented a vision system which can be controlled through the human gaze. We measured the vertical and horizontal electrooculogram signals and controlled the pan and tilt of a cap-mounted webcam to keep the object of interest in focus and at the centre of the picture. A simple ‘signature’ extraction procedure was also utilized to reduce the algorithmic complexity and system storage capacity. The developed device has been tested with ten healthy participants. We approximated the object orientation and the size of the object and determined an appropriate wrist orientation angle and the grasp aperture size within 22 ms. The combined accuracy exceeded 75%. The integration of the proposed system with the brain-controlled grasp assistive device and increasing the number of grasps can offer more natural manoeuvring in grasp for ALS patients. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Autonomic mobile base (MB)'s location upper-body's configuration design and control are two of the fundamental issues to realize robotic autonomy. Besides, the human-like behaviors capacity is essential for human-robot interaction scenarios. Thus, to achieve human-like autonomy, this paper proposes a motion planning and tracking strategy for a redundant dual-arm humanoid mobile manipulator system. Specifically, the inverse dynamic reachability map (iDRM), the improved MaxiMin NSGA-II and the direct-connect bidirectional RRT gradient descent algorithms are employed. Firstly, iRM is constructed and used to design potential MB's location area. Then, the improved MaxiMin NSGA-II algorithm is used to determine the desired end-pose based on the selected MB's location area. After the desired end-pose is designed, the direct-connect bidirectional RRT gradient descent algorithm will be used to generate the approaching trajectory from the initial pose to the desired end-pose. Finally, the RBFNN controller is used to track the planned trajectory. On the other hand, if there are new obstacles, iDRM will be obtained by updating iRM. iRM and iDRM accelerate the desired end-pose design by narrowing MB's searching area. Moreover, to achieve human-like motions five criteria including the end-effectors' (EE) displacement with respect to MB are proposed. Several motion planning simulations are realized that validate the proposed strategy.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A key problem in robotics is enabling an autonomous agent to perform human-like arm movements in close proximity to another human. However, modeling the human decision and control process of the movement during dyadic interaction presents a challenge. Although, most prior approaches rely on multicomponent robot motion planning architectures, we use data of two humans performing interfering arm reaching movements to extract and transfer interaction behavior control skill to a robotic agent. A recurrent neural network-based framework is constructed to learn a policy that computes control signals for a robot end effector in order to replace one human. The learned policy is benchmarked against unseen interaction data and a state-of-the-art learning from demonstration framework in simulated scenarios. We compare several architectures and investigate a new activation function of three stacked tanh(). The results show that the proposed framework successfully learns a policy to imitate human movement behavior control during dyadic interaction. The policy is transferred to a real robot and its feasibility for close-proximity human-robot interaction is shown. © 2016 IEEE.},

The literature has provided a better understanding about anticipatory locomotor adjustments based on global (whole body) movement, but how local limb movements of another pedestrian affect one's circumvention is not well known. The purpose of this study was to understand how local limb movements of another pedestrian affect the planning and execution to circumvent them. Ten healthy young adults (24.5 ± 3.0 years) were immersed in a virtual environment representing a shopping mall. Participants walked to a shop located directly in front of them while circumventing a virtual agent which, when present, approached from straight ahead with one of four different locomotor patterns: 1-Normal locomotor movements; 2- No arm movements; 3- No leg movements; 4- No arm and leg movements (gliding to them). Circumvention trajectory, minimum clearance and coordination of head and trunk rotations along with center of mass lateral displacement were examined. Nonparametric Analysis of Longitudinal Data was used to compare variables across the different conditions. Minimum clearance was smaller for normal locomotor movements compared to all other conditions, but coordination of body movements and onset of circumvention trajectory deviations remained unchanged. These results suggest that global body movement is sufficient to plan circumvention trajectories in a predictable avoidance task, but clearance safety margins are influenced by the local limb movements of another pedestrian. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To pour various contents from a container, a robot needs to be able to generate a trajectory of its arm, to grasp containers, and to estimate the amount poured. We propose a method only based on tactile sensing to generate the overall pouring motion including all the required abilities. Using a robot arm, we generated a human-like tipping motion and developed a grasping strategy to prevent slippage of the robot's fingertips for objects whose center of gravity changes while pouring. With this method, the robot uses the fingertip forces to estimate the amount poured independently of the material being poured and the working environment of the robot. By using a tactile-based pouring motion rather than a vision-based pouring motion, we expect the robot to achieve a general-purpose, robust, and highly accurate pouring motion. We evaluated the usefulness of the proposed tactile-based pouring motion through pouring experiments where the robot poured the contents from a plastic bottle into a cup. The robot pours the three types of materials with different particle sizes from a plastic bottle into a cup. The results showed that the proposed method enabled the robot to pour the contents into the cup while estimating the mass of the poured material with an error less than 17 grams. © 2019 IEEE.},

A well-studied approach to meet these requirements is to ensure human-like robot motions. Classic solutions for anthropomorphic movement generation usually rely on optimization procedures, which build upon hypotheses devised from neuroscientific literature, or capitalize on learning methods. However, these approaches come with limitations, e.g. limited motion variability or the need for high dimensional datasets. In this work, we present a technique to directly embed human upper limb principal motion modes computed through functional analysis in the robot trajectory optimization. We report on the implementation with manipulators with redundant anthropomorphic kinematic architectures - although dissimilar with respect to the human model used for functional mode extraction - via Cartesian impedance control. In our experiments, we show how human trajectories mapped onto a robotic manipulator still exhibit the main characteristics of human-likeness, e.g. low jerk values. We discuss the results with respect to the state of the art, and their implications for advanced human-robot interaction in industrial co-botics and for human assistance. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous control of force and motion is important in everyday activities when humans interact with objects. While many studies have analyzed the control of movement within a perturbing force field, few have investigated its dual aspects of controlling a contact force in nonisometric conditions. The mechanism by which the central nervous system controls forces during movements is still unclear, and it can be elucidated by estimating the mechanical properties of the arm during tasks with concurrent motion and contact force goals. We investigate how arm mechanics change when a force control task is accomplished during low-frequency positional perturbations of the arm. Contrary to many force regulation algorithms implemented in robotics, where contact impedance is decreased to reduce force fluctuations in response to position disturbances, we observed a steady increase of arm endpoint stiffness as the task progressed. Based on this evidence, we propose a theoretical framework suggesting that an internal model of the perturbing trajectory is formed. We observed that force regulation in the presence of predictable positional disturbances is implemented using a position control strategy together with the modulation of the endpoint stiffness magnitude, where the direction of the endpoint stiffness ellipse’s major axis is oriented toward the desired force.

We introduce an approach for learning dexterous grasping. Our key idea is to embed an object-centric visual affordance model within a deep reinforcement learning loop to learn grasping policies that favor the same object regions favored by people. Unlike traditional approaches that learn from human demonstration trajectories (e.g., hand joint sequences captured with a glove), the proposed prior is object-centric and image-based, allowing the agent to anticipate useful affordance regions for objects unseen during policy learning. We demonstrate our idea with a 30-DoF five-fingered robotic hand simulator on 40 objects from two datasets, where it successfully and efficiently learns policies for stable functional grasps. Our affordance-guided policies are significantly more effective, generalize better to novel objects, train 3× faster than the baselines, and are more robust to noisy sensor readings and actuation. Our work offers a step towards manipulation agents that learn by watching how people use objects, without requiring state and action information about the human body.

	abstract = {Sensory feedback is pivotal for a proficient dexterity of the hand. By modulating the grip force in function of the quick and not completely predictable change of the load force, grabbed objects are prevented to slip from the hand. Slippage control is an enabling achievement to all manipulation abilities. However, in hand prosthetics, the performance of even the most innovative research solutions proposed so far to control slippage remain distant from the human physiology. Indeed, slippage control involves parallel and compensatory activation of multiple mechanoceptors, spinal and supraspinal reflexes, and higher-order voluntary behavioral adjustments. In this work, we reviewed the literature on physiological correlates of slippage to propose a three-phases model for the slip sensation and reaction. Furthermore, we discuss the main strategies employed so far in the research studies that tried to restore slippage control in amputees. In the light of the proposed three-phase slippage model and from the weaknesses of already implemented solutions, we proposed several physiology-inspired solutions for slippage control to be implemented in the future hand prostheses. Understanding the physiological basis of slip detection and perception and implementing them in novel hand feedback system would make prosthesis manipulation more efficient and would boost its perceived naturalness, fostering the sense of agency for the hand movements.  © 2021 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the structure of human arms, a modular cable-driven human-like robotic arm (CHRA) is developed for safe human–robot interaction. Due to the unilateral driving properties of the cables, the CHRA is redundantly actuated and its stiffness can be adjusted by regulating the cable tensions. Since the trajectory of the 3-DOF joint module (3DJM) of the CHRA is a curve on Lie group SO(3), an enhanced stiffness model of the 3DJM is established by the covariant derivative of the load to the displacement on SO(3). In this paper, we focus on analyzing the how cable tension distribution problem oriented the enhanced stiffness of the 3DJM of the CHRA for stiffness adjustment. Due to the complexity of the enhanced stiffness model, it is difficult to solve the cable tensions from the desired stiffness analytically. The problem of stiffness-oriented cable tension distribution (SCTD) is formulated as a nonlinear optimization model. The optimization model is simplified using the symmetry of the enhanced stiffness model, the rank of the Jacobian matrix and the equilibrium equation of the 3DJM. Since the objective function is too complicated to compute the gradient, a method based on the genetic algorithm is proposed for solving this optimization problem, which only utilizes the objective function values. A comprehensive simulation is carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The result shows: at the optimal handover position, all subjects' joint angles are similar. Therefore, the optimal handover position can be determined by forward kinematics based on the measured average joint angles. Then, to plan the humanlike handover motion, a method proposed for a simple obstacle-present environment.

Achieving human-like object manipulation remains a challenge especially due to the control complexity of the anthropomorphic robotic hand with a high degree of freedom. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train a policy using a synergy space for generating natural grasping and relocation of variously shaped objects using an anthropomorphic robotic hand. A synergy space is created using a continuous normalizing flow network with point clouds of haptic areas, representing natural hand poses obtained from human grasping demonstrations. The DRL policy accesses the synergistic representation and derives natural hand poses through a deep regressor for object grasping and relocation tasks. Our proposed synergy-based DRL achieves an average success rate of 88.38% for the object manipulation tasks, while the standard DRL without synergy space only achieves 50.66%. Qualitative results show the proposed synergy-based DRL policy produces human-like finger placements over the surface of each object including apple, banana, flashlight, camera, lightbulb, and hammer. © 2021 by the authors.

As the basic part of motion of humanoid robot, human-like motion planning is always one of the research hotspots and difficulties. In this paper, a comprehensive approach is proposed to help robot NAO generate the human-like arm movements. Firstly, a novel arm motion mode is built based on the Movement Primitives (MPs). The whole arm movement can be decoupled into different simple sub-movements with different motion models, which improves the accuracy and computational efficiency of human-like arm movements. Then a motion decision algorithm based on Bayesian Network (BN) is proposed to help robot NAO choose the suitable motion model among these MPs. Finally, according to the structure features of the MPs, the IK solutions can be classified into two categories: methods based on index and on geometrical constraints. Through the comprehensive approach, the robot NAO can generate various human-like arm movements with satisfactory accuracy. The availability of the approach is verified by similarity experiment and human-like movement experiment. © The Author(s) 2020.},

It is assumed that humans move optimal with respect to a certain objective or cost function. To find this function, also for a robot, we use an inverse optimal control approach identifying what linear weighted combination of physically interpretable cost functions best mimics human point-to-point motions. A bi-level optimization is used, where the upper level compares the optimal robot result of the lower level with human reference motions. Two depth cameras are combined in a setup to record these reference motions. The resulting weighted cost functions are then used to generate new motions for a seven degrees of freedom robot arm. The resulting optimized motions are compared to standard robot motions based on linear interpolation in joint or task space. The comparison is performed by means of a small experiment where preliminary observations show that humans experience these motions as more anthropomorphic and feel at least equally comfortable and safe compared to existing motion planning strategies.

Then, in order to link the initial pose and that optimal pose, an off-line motion planning algorithm is designed. In detail, an efficient direct-connect bidirectional RRT and gradient descent algorithm is proposed to reduce the sampled nodes largely, and a geometric optimization method is proposed for path pruning. Besides, head forward behaviors are realized by calculating the reasonable orientations and assigning them to the mobile base to improve the quality of human-robot interaction. Third, the extension to online planning is done by introducing real-time sensing, collision-test and control cycles to update robotic motion in dynamic environments.

	abstract = {Computational path planning approaches can enable development of autonomous rehabilitation and assistive exoskeletons. Using a human-like reference behavior for such wearable systems can ensure safe, effective, and intuitive human–robot interaction. This is of significant importance since the quality of interaction and ergonomic considerations have a substantial effect on technology usability and acceptance by the users. This paper proposes a novel framework for generating human-like paths for wearable exoskeletons in the shoulder-elbow level. The introduced method is a two-stage process where a human-like reference path is planned in the configuration space of the human arm, followed by an analytical transformation that directly maps the derived path to the configuration space of the exoskeleton. The analytical mapping presented is a function of the kinematic parameters of the system and can be adapted for other upper-limb exoskeletons. As a case study, the proposed method is used for generating human-like reference motions for a six-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton supporting scapulohumeral rhythm, glenohumeral rotations, and elbow flexion/extension. Firstly, it is shown that reaching motions associated with activities of daily living can be predicted with high accuracy in the human joint space. This is demonstrated by analyzing the experimental data collected from healthy subjects. Subsequently, it is verified through kinematic analysis that the transformation of generated paths to the exoskeleton configuration space does not alter their spatial profile in the task space. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

This work seeks to expand validation experiments by conducting dynamic simulations of finger motion and fingertip forces simultaneously. To conduct dynamic validation, parameters of the bond graph model need to be calibrated for dynamic motion. Using Utah’s Anatomically-correct Robotic Testbed (UART) finger, model parameters were estimated using experimental methods.

The proposed method can be used in exoskeletons with 3 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) in shoulder and 1 DoF in elbow, which are capable of supporting shoulder girdle. Existing computational reference generation methods are based on the assumption of fixed shoulder center during motions. However, most upper limb motions such as ADL include large scale reaching motions, during which the center of shoulder joint moves significantly. The proposed method generates the user specific reference motion in the human arm joint space and through a transformation the developed motion can be mapped into exoskeleton joint space. Comparison of the computational model outputs with experimental results of healthy subjects performing ADL, show that the proposed model is able to reproduce human-like motions. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is one of the most employed strategies to process inertial signals collected with a handheld device for autonomous indoor positioning. This strategy is based on step length models that usually combine step characteristics with some physiological parameters. These models are calibrated with experimental data for each user. However, many physiological conditions are affecting the walking gait even for steady walking. Therefore, frequent calibration is needed to cope with walking pattern variations. Moreover, PDR models are not adapted to high walking velocities and to the specific walking patterns of some populations like elderly people and pathological cases. In light of these limitations, the modeling of human walking, which considers the induced arm swinging behavior, is needed for improving self-contained inertial indoor navigation. In this paper, a human-like walking model is developed in order to represent and study the correlations between the hand acceleration and gait characteristics. Experimental data were collected from motion capture experiments on one healthy subject in order to validate the model. Results show that the model fitted to the test subject reproduces the walking features found in experiments, as well as the same tendencies in function of the walking velocity. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this paper, a novel human-like motion planning strategy is proposed to help anthropomorphic arms generate human-like movements accurately. The strategy consists of three parts: movement primitives, Bayesian network (BN), and a novel coupling neural network (CPNN). The movement primitives are used to decouple the human arm movements. The classification of arm movements improves the accuracy of human-like movements. The motion-decision algorithm based on BN is able to predict occurrence probabilities of the motions and choose appropriate mode of motion. Then, a novel CPNN is proposed to solve the inverse kinematics problems of anthropomorphic arms. The CPNN integrates different models into a single network and reflects the features of these models by changing the network structure. Through the strategy, the anthropomorphic arms can generate various human-like movements with satisfactory accuracy. Finally, the availability of the proposed strategy is verified by simulations for the general motion of humanoid NAO. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {In human-made scenarios, robots need to be able to fully operate objects in their surroundings, i.e., objects are required to be functionally grasped rather than only picked. This imposes very strict constraints on the object pose such that a direct grasp can be performed. Inspired by the anthropomorphic nature of humanoid robots, we propose an approach that first grasps an object with one hand, obtaining full control over its pose, and performs the functional grasp with the second hand subsequently. Thus, we develop a fully autonomous pipeline for dual-Arm functional regrasping of novel familiar objects, i.e., objects never seen before that belong to a known object category, e.g., spray bottles. This process involves semantic segmentation, object pose estimation, non-rigid mesh registration, grasp sampling, handover pose generation and in-hand pose refinement. The latter is used to compensate for the unpredictable object movement during the first grasp. The approach is applied to a human-like upper body. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first system that exhibits autonomous bimanual functional regrasping capabilities. We demonstrate that our system yields reliable success rates and can be applied on-line to real-world tasks using only one off-The-shelf RGB-D sensor. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Impedance control is a very classic control method in robot and human interaction. Humans use their ability to adaptively adjust arm impedance parameters to perform well in a variety of tasks. This ability allows us to successfully complete interactive tasks even in uncertain disturbance environments. By analyzing the results of many force field experiments, We got a conclusion that humans usually use two methods to change their impedance in external perturbations: 1) In the situation of unpredictable perturbations, humans adapt their impedance through muscle contraction; 2) In the situation of predictable perturbations, humans adds a constant term to offset the known perturbations. In this paper, We show how 3-DOFs simulated robot use the reinforcement learning algorithm to perform similar behavior in both situations. We apply our model-free reinforcement learning algorithm PI2 (policy improvement with path integrals) to the robot to learn the end-effector variable impedance schedules and trajectories. Our findings provide a approach to automatically learn the impedance empirically without requiring to build a physical or environmental dynamics model. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Humans are fast throwers, and their bodies differ correspondingly from those of other hominids. One might ask why humans evolved to throw fast while others did not; whether the design of a fast thrower is unique or special and whether indeed humans remain fast within broader comparison sets of non-hominid throwers. As a non-hominid comparison set, we consider a random population of five-link robots with simplified joint angle and torque constraints. We generate 20,000 such robot models and sequentially optimize their throwing motion. Since good initial guesses are needed for each optimization, the robots are first arranged in distance-minimizing sequences in design parameter space. Each robot’s optimal throw then serves as an initial guess for the next one in sequence. Multiple traversals of these sequences, and random perturbations, are used to avoid local optima. Subsequently, regression models are used to predict throwing performance as a function of robot design parameters. From these regression models, the dominant heuristic predictor of fast throwing is found to be a long and light last link. Direct optimization of the robot design leads to much faster throwers, also with long and light last links. In striking contrast, the human arm has two equally long intermediate links of significant mass. Nevertheless, a somewhat human-like arm within the same robot set is found to be a good thrower. On combining several throwing criteria to obtain a single figure of merit, the human-like arm lies in the 96th percentile of the population. Since our human-like arm is a crude approximation of an actual human arm, we suggest that fast throwing by human-like robot arms is not inherently difficult from a mechanical point of view. © 2018, Indian Academy of Sciences.},

This paper describes the application of a human-like dual arm aerial manipulator for the inspection of pipe structures, typical of chemical plants, involving the installation and retrieval of sensor devices. The goal is to reduce the time, cost, and risk with respect to conventional solutions conducted by human workers. Two configurations of the aerial robot are considered and compared: the standard, in which the arms are installed at the base of the multirotor, and the long reach configuration in passive pendulum, which extends the effective workspace of the manipulator and increases safety during the operation on flight. The kinematic and dynamic models of both configurations are derived, proposing a unified notation for the equations of motion, and a force/position control scheme that relies on the servo controller and the mechanical joint compliance. The paper also describes a simulation framework used for validating the execution of the aerial manipulation task before the realization of the real experiments, which contributes to reducing the probability of failure.

A robot provides consistent and predictable productivity that reduces management oversight. In manufacturing system, a manipulator arm is a type of robot that commonly used to pick and place the workpieces into a certain position. This paper describes a prototype of manipulator arm for implementing pick-and-place task in industrial robot system. Manipulator arm separates items based on the color detected by the TCS3200 color sensor and then processed by the ATmega2560 microcontroller. Furthermore, the output of the microcontroller will send a signal to four servomotor drivers to move the robot arm in the desired direction. The robot picks objects and places them in the designated place. The experiments are carried out to pick objects with certain colors and shapes and place into the provided container.

On the one hand, the end-effector should move along a predictable and short path while on the other hand joint movement and acceleration should be kept to a minimum. Obstacles in the workspace or joint limits complicate the situation even further. Constructing a metric that makes undesired configurations more expensive to travel through, we equip the joint space with a notion of cost. The motion planning task then reduces to the problem of finding cheapest paths connecting two configurations - so-called geodesics. We show how to construct suitable metrics for a variety of typical scenarios and present an efficient algorithm for the computation of the corresponding geodesics.

With highly redundant joints and actuators, the musculoskeletal system of human can fulfill movement and operation with high precision, flexibility, and reliability. However, the redundancy of the musculoskeletal system also brings great difficulties to the control and fabrication of a human-like robot. Therefore, we propose an algorithm based on the convex hull theory to effectively reduce the number of redundant muscles. Specifically, taking the strength limitation and state-dependent characteristics of muscles into consideration, by analyzing the torque contribution of muscles for the discrete motion of joints, each muscle can be represented by a feature vector, and the convex hulls are formed by these vectors in high-dimensional space. By applying the proposed algorithm, the muscles corresponding to the vertexes of the convex hull are reserved while the redundant muscles within the convex hull are deleted, and a simplified model can be obtained. Sets of motion experiments demonstrate that the simplified model can achieve high-precision movement as a complete model. Based on the simplified model, a hardware platform of a robotic arm is constructed, which consists of six degrees of freedom and 11 pneumatic muscles. © 2016 IEEE.},

Several human demonstrations of different objects grasping are measured using the Xsens MVN suite and then mapped to a seven Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robotic arm. Exploiting the anthropomorphism of the kinematic structure of the manipulator, two Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics (CLIK) algorithms are used to reproduce accurately the master’s movements. Once the database of movements is created, the synergies subspace are derived applying the Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) in the joint space. A mean function, a set of basis functions for each joint and a pre-defined number of scalar coefficients are obtained for each demonstration. In the computed subspace each demonstration can be parametrized by means of a few number of coefficients, preserving the major variance of the entire movement. Moreover, a Multilevel Neural Networks (MNNs) is trained in order to approximate the relationship between the object characteristics and the synergies coefficients, allowing generalization for unknown objects. The tests are conducted on a setup composed by a KUKA LWR 4+ Arm and a SCHUNK 5-Finger Hand, using the Xsens MVN suite to acquire the demonstrations. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel wearable robotic glove or exo-glove design scalable to the variation of the hand kinematics. While most of the traditional robot hand is driven by rotating the joint directly with a rigid body, our exo-glove deforms a robotic finger's skin and, thus, the hand skeleton joints. Multiple tendons woven on the exo-glove's surface can make multi-DOF finger joint motions. We allocated tendons to mimic a hand's intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. Thus, a robotic hand actuated with the exo-glove can perform natural finger motions, including abduction/adduction and flexion/extension of finger joints. Moreover, additional tendons for the thumb enable power grips and the robotic hand's human-like motion. The proposed design approach places all the actuators on the surface without directly actuating any of the hand skeleton's joint. Therefore, a random hand skeleton can work as a robotic hand by putting the wearable robotic glove on it. Thus, the proposed model provides a high degree of freedom on choosing hand skeletons. We expect the aforementioned biomimetic features of our proposed method will benefit not only traditional robotic hands design but also the design of prosthetic hands and robot power-assisted hand glove. © Copyright © 2020 Park, Hwang and Lee.},

However, learning from demonstration to generate a new action with human behavioral characteristics in the varying situation is challenging. Generally, dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) method can generalize the trajectory imitating the demonstration, but cannot integrate the feature of multiple trajectories of different targets. In this paper, the proposed method contains two aspects of learning and generating. The statistical method Gaussian mixture model and Gaussian mixture regression (GMM-GMR) is used to extract the common characteristic and eliminate the uncertainty of the multiple demonstrations. To exert the ability of DMPs to generate a human-like motion to a new goal, and we model the shape parameter with locally weighted regression (LWR) method. To enhance the ability of DMPs in multiple trajectories learning, we propose the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) method to construct the regression model of shape parameters to reflect the human intentions, with respect to the target position. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we design a peg-in-hole experiment with proving generalization and obstacle avoidance performance. The results have shown that the strategy integrated the generalization of DMPs and feature regeneration ability of MV-GPR method, and the generated valid trajectory could achieve the peg-in-hole task with 6-DOF whole-arm avoidance. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Humans have a particular way of moving their body when interacting with the environment and with other humans. The movement of the body is commonly known and expresses the intention of the action. The express of intent by our movement is classified as non-verbal cues, and from them, it is possible to understand and anticipate the actions of humans. In robotics, humans need to understand the intention of the robot in order to efficiently and safely interact in a dyadic activity. If robots could possess the same non-verbal cues when executing the same actions, then humans would be capable of interacting with robots the way they interact with other humans.We propose a robotic controller capable of executing actions of moving objects on a table (placing) and handover objects to humans (giving) in a human-like behaviour. Our first contribution is to model the behaviour of the non-verbal cues of a human interacting with other humans while performing placing and giving actions. From the recordings of the motion of the human, we build a computational model of the trajectory of the head, torso, and arm for the different actions. Additionally, the human motion model was consolidated with the integration of a previously developed human gaze behaviour model. As a second contribution, we embedded this model in the controller of an iCub humanoid robot and compared the generated trajectories to the real human model, and additionally, compare with the existing minimum-jerk controller for the iCub (iKin).Our results show that it is possible to model the complete upper body human behaviour during placing and giving interactions, and the generated trajectories from the model give a better approximation of the human-like behaviour in a humanoid robot than the existing inverse kinematics solver. From this work, we can conclude that our controller is capable of achieving a humanlike behaviour for the robot which is a step towards robots capable of understanding and being understood by humans. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this article, a fuzzy-approximation-based adaptive backstepping control method for dual-arm of a humanoid robot was proposed. The purpose of this control system is to provide coordinated movement assistance to enable the humanoid robot’s human-like forearm to grab objects coordinately (or track any continuous desired trajectory), even in the presence of environmental disturbances and parametric uncertainties. We analyze the proposed adaptive backstepping by mathematical modeling and actually measure the robot dual-arm motion information of a number of case when they simulate the trajectory to verify the model. We design the adaptive fuzzy-approximation control strategy and combining the synthesis of the robust design, backstepping control, and Lyapunov function method, the proposed adaptive fuzzy backstepping control does not need to know the humanoid robot’s arms model precisely. In the control system proposed here, once the desired trajectories of the robot’s dual-arm positions are given, the adaptive fuzzy system was closed to any unknown functions and to the derivative of the virtual control law of the humanoid robot system. In this case, a robust design scheme was utilized to compensate for any approximation errors. With the proposed trajectory tracking, not only able to generate the coordinate motions for a humanoid robot’s two arms, but it can also control the arms to move to the desired positions. The proposed closed-loop system under the adaptive fuzzy backstepping control design was effective and that asymptotic stability was successfully achieved. The adaptive fuzzy-approximation backstepping control strategy should be more complete and intelligent and more actual test should be conducted to further evaluate the effect of the proposed trajectory tracking. The instability of dual-arm of humanoid robot system is systematically analyzed and a backstepping control strategy based on the adaptive fuzzy-approximation to improve the continuity of trajectory tracking of the robot’s arms is proposed. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to realize a human-like massage tapping motion based on an anthropomorphic dual arm robot. The tapping motion is a unique technique in massage since it is much different from other massage techniques like kneading, stroking, acupressure and so on. The rate and rhythm are the most significant features which should be well-controlled in the tapping motion. To implement an effective robotic tapping motion, the on-line trajectory generator(OTG) is utilized to control the frequency during each tapping. Furthermore, since the massage is a human-contact motion, the safety of conducting a massage should be considered seriously. This paper uses the Cartesian based impedance control to enhance the safety and contact detection to satisfy diverse force demands during the robotic tapping motion. By these control methods, the feasibility of the tapping massage therapy based on robotic tapping motion is verified by the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the robotic tapping motion has reached 88 percentage similarity to the tapping motion of a massage therapist in different needed force. And the correlation coefficient is calculated to be about 0.95 which means there is a high positive relation between the robotic complete tapping motion and the human complete tapping motion. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Human arm movements are highly stereotypical under a large variety of experimental conditions. This is striking due to the high redundancy of the human musculoskeletal system, which in principle allows many possible trajectories toward a goal. Many researchers hypothesize that through evolution, learning, and adaption, the human system has developed optimal control strategies to select between these possibilities. Various optimality principles were proposed in the literature that reproduce human-like trajectories in certain conditions. However, these studies often focus on a single cost function and use simple torque-driven models of motion generation, which are not consistent with human muscle-actuated motion. The underlying structure of our human system, with the use of muscle dynamics in interaction with the control principles, might have a significant influence on what optimality principles best model human motion. To investigate this hypothesis, we consider a point-to-manifold reaching task that leaves the target underdetermined. Given hypothesized motion objectives, the control input is generated using Bayesian optimization, which is a machine learning based method that trades-off exploitation and exploration.

	abstract = {In the past few years, the raise of space robotics yielded novel potential applications. The utilization of more advanced and capable robotic manipulators opens a whole new horizon of possibilities for future space missions, ranging from On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) of existing satellites (for refuelling, Orbital replacement unit (ORU) or de-orbiting) to On-Orbit Assembly (OOA) and reconfiguration of modular spacecraft. This paper deals with the design and primary Manufacturing, Assembly, Integration and Testing (MAIT) activities of a novel robotic manipulator demonstrator for such on-orbit applications. MOSAR-WM is a 7 degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator, 1.6-meter long, symmetrical and relocatable (aka. “walking” capable). Its overall structure is human-like with asymmetric joints. Manipulator joints are hollow-shaft for internal cable routing, and include cutting-edge space-compatible technologies. Each joint embeds a torque sensor in addition to position sensors (incremental and absolute encoders). The kinematic architecture of MOSAR-WM offers a wide end effector workspace, and its stiff structure guarantees a high accuracy and repeatability while allowing compactness for launching and storing purposes. Each extremity of MOSAR-WM is equipped with a HOTDOCK standard interface that allows for mechanical connection, powering and controlling the arm. Manipulator avionics consists in seven joint controllers (one per joint) and an embedded computer called Walking manipulator controller (WMC) running a real time operating system. The WMC receives high-level commands from the external computing unit through the connected HOTDOCK interface. It also calculates the dynamic model of the robot to provide proper feed-forward terms for the joint control. Depending on the desired behaviour, the gains of the joint control loop are adaptive for optimal performance in position control. In addition, a Cartesian impedance control is implemented to allow for compliant operations. The joint controllers are daisy-chained through EtherCAT, while the control of each HOTDOCK is performed through a CAN bus managed by the internal WMC. MOSAR-WM is developed in the context of the European Commission's Space Robotic H2020 MOSAR project. It aims to validate the developed technologies at Technology Readiness level (TRL) 4 in a space representative scenario. Copyright © 2020 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

	abstract = {In the context of human-robot collaboration in close proximity, safety and comfort are the two important aspects to achieve joint tasks efficiently. For safety, the robot must be able to avoid dynamic obstacles such as a human arm with high reliability. For comfort, the trajectories and avoidance behavior of the robot need to be predictable to the humans. Moreover, these two aspects might be different from person to person or from one task to another. This work presents a framework to generate predictable motions with dynamic obstacle avoidance for the robot interacting with the human by using policy improvement method. The trajectories are generated using Dynamic Motion Primitives with an additional potential field term that penalizes trajectories that may lead to collisions with obstacles. Furthermore, human movements are predicted using a data-driven approach for proactive avoidance. A cost function is defined which measures different aspects that affect the comfort and predictability of human co-workers (e.g., human response time, joint jerk). This cost function is then minimized during human-robot interaction by the means of policy improvement through black-box optimization to generate robot trajectories that adapt to human preferences and avoid obstacles. User studies are performed to evaluate the trust and comfort of human co-workers when working with the robot. In addition, the studies are also extended to various scenarios and different users to analyze the task transferability. This improves the learning performance when switching to a new task or the robot has to adapt to a different co-worker. © Copyright © 2019 Hoang Dinh, Oguz, Elsayed and Wollherr.},

The key idea of the proposal is to exploit dual sampling in a Cartesian space and self-motion manifolds to explore the entire configuration space. The C_FMT∗ reduces the constrained planning problem to the unconstrained instance by sampling in the obstacle-free Cartesian space and satisfying the task constraints; it can solve most of these constrained path planning tasks quickly and obtain lower cost solutions compared to the existing techniques. In addition, a validity checking method of Cartesian sampling points based on self-motion manifolds is introduced to ensure the probabilistic completeness of the new planner. By analyzing musculoskeletal models of the human arm and the muscle strength property, a torque effort criterion was deduced to generate biomimetic motion for anthropomorphic arms. Then, an H_FMT∗ that incorporates the FMT∗ algorithm with the torque effort criterion is also proposed and used to bias the tree growth toward human-like movements in the self-motion manifolds of the obtained path. Finally, the proposed approach has been illustrated with several real examples executed with a humanoid robot. The obtained results show that the paths obtained with the proposed approach are quicker and more human-like. © 1996-2012 IEEE.},

The expressive parameters are gesture velocity and acceleration, gesture size, arm swivel, and finger extension. Individual, parameter-matched gestures are then combined into animated sequences. We evaluate our gesture generation system in two perceptual studies. The first study compares our method to the ground truth gestures as well as mismatched gestures.

In general, the problem of predicting events in the future or between two waypoints is exceedingly difficult. However, most phenomena naturally pass through relatively predictable bottlenecks-while we cannot predict the precise trajectory of a robot arm between being at rest and holding an object up, we can be certain that it must have picked the object up. To exploit this, we decouple visual prediction from a rigid notion of time. While conventional approaches predict frames at regularly spaced temporal intervals, our time-agnostic predictors (TAP) are not tied to specific times so that they may instead discover predictable “bottleneck” frames no matter when they occur. We evaluate our approach for future and intermediate frame prediction across three robotic manipulation tasks. Our predictions are not only of higher visual quality, but also correspond to coherent semantic subgoals in temporally extended tasks. © 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019.

	abstract = {Human-like behavior has emerged in the robotics area for improving the quality of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). For the human-like behavior imitation, the kinematic mapping between a human arm and robot manipulator is one of the popular solutions. To fulfill this requirement, a reconstruction method called swivel motion was adopted to achieve human-like imitation. This approach aims at modeling the regression relationship between robot pose and swivel motion angle. Then it reaches the human-like swivel motion using its redundant degrees of the manipulator. This characteristic holds for most of the redundant anthropomorphic robots. Although artificial neural network (ANN) based approaches show moderate robustness, the predictive performance is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) structure for reconstruction enhancement and reducing online prediction time. Finally, we utilized the trained DCNN model for managing redundancy control a 7 DoFs anthropomorphic robot arm (LWR4+, KUKA, Germany) for validation. A demonstration is presented to show the human-like behavior on the anthropomorphic manipulator.

Human-like morphology and motion are often considered key features for intuitive human–robot interactions because they allow human peers to easily predict the final intention of a robotic movement. Here, we present a novel motion planning algorithm, the Human-like Upper-limb Motion Planner, for the upper limb of anthropomorphic robots, that generates collision-free trajectories with human-like characteristics. Mainly inspired from established theories of human motor control, the planning process takes into account a task-dependent hierarchy of spatial and postural constraints modelled as cost functions. For experimental validation, we generate arm-hand trajectories in a series of tasks including simple point-to-point reaching movements and sequential object-manipulation paradigms. Being a major contribution to the current literature, specific focus is on the kinematics of naturalistic arm movements during the avoidance of obstacles. To evaluate human-likeness, we observe kinematic regularities and adopt smoothness measures that are applied in human motor control studies to distinguish between well-coordinated and impaired movements. The results of this study show that the proposed algorithm is capable of planning arm-hand movements with human-like kinematic features at a computational cost that allows fluent and efficient human–robot interactions. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {A novel motion planning method is proposed to generate human-like motion for anthropomorphic robot arms. Its highlight is to consider the robot arm to be human-like not only in its configuration but also in its motion patterns. To achieve this, the intrinsic mechanisms of human arm motion generation are transferred to robot motion planning. First, human arm motion is modeled using human arm motion primitives. The mechanisms of human arm motion generation are dissected from a large number of motion samples, reflected in the types, sequencing and quantification rules/laws of the primitives. Next, the human arm motion patterns are studied based on primitive chains. Finally, a new motion planning method is built that autonomously performs motion pattern decisions, motion time allocation, and joint trajectory generation. The proposed method is validated by a motion planning app and a robot simulation. © 2021 IEEE},

	abstract = {Bending soft robots must be structured and predictable to be used in applications such as a grasping hand. We developed soft robot fingers with embedded bones to improve the performance of a puppetry robot with haptic feedback. The manufacturing process for bone-inspired soft robots is described, and two mathematical models are reported: one to predict the stiffness and natural frequency of the robot finger and the other for trajectory planning. Experiments using different prototypes were used to set model parameters. The first model, which had a fourth-order lumped mass-spring-damper configuration, was able to predict the natural frequency of the soft robot with a maximum error of 18%. The model and the experimental data demonstrated that bone-inspired soft robots have higher natural frequency, lower phase shift, better controllability, and higher stiffness compared with traditional fiber-reinforced bending soft robots. We also showed that the dynamic performance of a bending soft robot is independent of whether water or air is used for the media and independent of the media pressure. Results from the second model showed that the path of a bone-inspired soft robot is a function of the relative lengths of the bone segments, which means that the model can be used to direct the design of the robot to achieve the desired trajectory. This model was able to correctly predict the trajectory path of the robot. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.},

	abstract = {Inspired from established human motor control theories, our HUMP algorithm plans upper-limb collisions-free movements for anthropomorphic systems, which show kinematic human-like features [1]. Related cognitive issues can be further resolved when robots act as they are familiar with their workspace and can take initiative faster than in the early onsets of a task. Here, a continual learning technique is proposed to improve the performance of the HUMP under uncertainties of the items in a given scenario. Given the locality of the optimization-based HUMP algorithm, a meaningful initial guess, predicted from similar past motion experiences, can significantly reduce the computational cost and put the robot into action arguably faster than in the first attempts of planning with inexperienced initial guesses. This prediction is proposed to be incrementally refined by an optimal locally weighted regression method that operates on datasets of situational features that are regularly updated as new movements are planned by the robot in similar scenarios. The proposed cyclic experiential learner is tested on the selection of optimal human-like target postures in a reaching task with a large obstacle obstructing the straight-line path towards a given target. Results demonstrate the capability of extracting meaningful situational features in few sessions of online learning with a very limited size of the datasets. Comparisons with simple Euclidean locally weighted regression and random initializations showed the capability of planning target configurations of better quality with less computational cost. The proposed approach also exhibits to be robust against the interferences of new incoming samples depicting slightly changed situations of the same task.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the paradigm shift from hospital-centric healthcare to home-centric healthcare in Healthcare 4.0, healthcare robotics has become one of the fastest growing fields of robotics. The combination of robot capabilities with human intelligence, for example, telerobotics for home care, is gradually showing promising potentials. In this paper, the Home-TeleBot system, a generalized IoT-enabled telerobotic architecture designed to support home-centric healthcare system, is proposed. In particular, the implementation of it is realized by integrating human-motion-capture subsystem with robot-control subsystem. The dual-arm cooperative robot, YuMi, imitates human motion captured by a set of wearable inertial motion capture devices to complete tasks. The proposed approach using workspace mapping and path planning of robot manipulators, facilitates telerobot to execute tasks in a natural and human-like way. Based on the constant of proportionality calculated by comparing the human original workspace with the robot original workspace, the workspace mapping is achieved by making assumptions of the distance between end-effectors (human hands, robot's grippers) and shoulders. Additionally, robot manipulators' path is planned by setting virtual obstacles to constrain robot motion, which aims to improve the performance of robot's human-like motion. As a specific example of application, we apply the proposed architecture to a fetching task based on dual-arm motion capture and mapping for telerobotics in home care. © 2013 IEEE.},

Diverse studies from different fields of research suggest a less coherent understanding of the muscles' functionality in cyclic, sagittal plane locomotion. We structured this review of biarticular muscle function by reflecting biomechanical template models, human experiments and robotic system designs. Within these approaches, we surveyed the contribution of biarticular muscles to the locomotor subfunctions (stance, balance and swing). While mono- and biarticular muscles do not show physiological differences, the reviewed studies provide evidence for complementary and locomotor subfunction-specific contributions of mono- and biarticular muscles. In stance, biarticular muscles coordinate joint movements, improve economy (e.g. by transferring energy) and secure the zig-zag configuration of the leg against joint overextension. These commonly known functions are extended by an explicit role of biarticular muscles in controlling the angular momentum for balance and swing. Human-like leg arrangement and intrinsic (compliant) properties of biarticular structures improve the controllability and energy efficiency of legged robots and assistive devices. Future interdisciplinary research on biarticular muscles should address their role for sensing and control as well as non-cyclic and/or non-sagittal motions, and non-static moment arms. © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel finger kinematic model for human hand configurations, which applies to the realization of a naturalistic human finger motion for robotic finger systems and artificial hands. The proposed finger model is derived based on the geometry of a hand shape grasping a virtual cylindrical object. The model is capable of describing the natural rotation configuration of the joints of a long finger with three degrees of freedom by a single parameter, i.e., the radius of a cylindrical object. Experimental validation of the model shows that it can simulate closely naturalistic human finger movements. With the use of the proposed model, discussions were made on how to achieve multifinger coordination that makes task-specific hand movements or a posture for specific hand actions. Due to the simplicity of the model to define joints angle configuration in a long finger by a single parameter, the combination of the proposed model and the multifinger coordination concept discussed can be seen as an inclusive framework in human-like hand systems design and control. This paper is the first step toward exploring future novel combined design–control strategies for the development of under-actuated prosthetic and powered orthotic devices for the naturalistic motion that are based on both Cartesian space trajectory tracking and joint angle coordination.

These qualities allow a human user to first understand what the model has learned, and then either correct the learned behavior or zero-shot generalize to new, similar tasks. Our inference method requires only low-level trajectories and a description of the environment in order to learn high-level rules.

	abstract = {Anthropomorphic criteria are widely adopted for developing socially interactive robots since they can improve human capability to interpret and predict robot motion, with an impact on robot acceptability and human–robot interaction safety. Learning by demonstration approaches based on dynamic movement primitives are a suitable solution for planning the robot motion in human-like fashion and endow robots with generalization capabilities and robustness against perturbation. Objective of this work is to propose a new formulation of the learning by demonstration approach based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs), called hybrid joint/Cartesian DMPs, for redundant robots with the twofold purpose of avoiding obstacles on the path and obtaining anthropomorphic motion in the joint as well as the task space. The proposed approach, suitable for assistive purposes, was experimentally validated on the anthropomorphic robot arm Kuka Light Weight Robot 4+. Trajectories recorded by an optoelectronic system (i.e. the BTS Smart D) from human demonstrators performing point-to-point reaching and pouring tasks were adopted to teach the robot how to move. A comparative analysis with current methods of learning by demonstration in the literature, i.e. Cartesian DMP and inverse kinematics, was performed. Performance indicators were introduced to (1) assess the robot accuracy of the motion performing, (2) evaluate the level of anthropomorphism of the computed motion, (3) measure the success rate in obstacle avoidance. Moreover, questionnaires were administered to ten human subjects who observed robot motion. The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed approach guarantees anthropomorphic motion of the robot both in the joint and in the task spaces ensuring obstacle avoidance along the robot kinematic chain. In particular, the anthropomorphic robot, while operating with the proposed method, exhibits behaviours in the joint space that are similar to the one recorded during the demonstration and has a level of anthropomorphism rather higher than the one obtained with Cartesian DMP and inverse kinematics (a configuration of the robot joints within the physiological limits is always ensured and the maximum convex hull created between the human and the robot arm is 0.0085 m3). In presence of obstacles, an acceptable level of the Cartesian accuracy (Positionerr<0.005 m and Orientationerr<0.02 rad) is achieved. The obstacles are avoided with a 100% of success. The questionnaire results showed that the users feel more comfortable and less nervous to interact with a robot that moves in human-like manner. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

Then, the grasp and motion synthesis step is done, which consists in generating potential grasps for a given object using the four family types, and planning the motions using a bi-directional multi-goal sampling-based planner, which efficiently guides the motion planning following the synergies in a reduced search space, resulting in paths with human-like appearance.

	abstract = {Robots learn as they interact with humans. Consider a human teleoperating an assistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects the arm's motion, the robot gathers information about the human's desired task. But how does the human know what their robot has inferred? Today's approaches often focus on conveying intent: for instance, using legible motions or gestures to indicate what the robot is planning. However, closing the loop on robot inference requires more than just revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should also display the alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human teacher when additional guidance is necessary. In this letter we propose a multimodal approach for communicating robot inference that combines both passive and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred, and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct the human's teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where the robot must infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context, we integrate passive and active modalities into a single algorithmic framework that determines when and which type of feedback to provide. Combining both passive and active feedback experimentally outperforms single modality baselines; during an in-person user study, we demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how efficiently humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount of time humans spend interacting with the robot.

	abstract = {This article presents a system for soft human–robot handshaking, using a soft robot hand in conjunction with a lightweight and impedance-controlled robot arm. Using this system, we study how different factors influence the perceived naturalness, and give the robot different personality traits. Capitalizing on recent findings regarding handshake grasp force regulation, and on studies of the impedance control of the human arm, we investigate the role of arm stiffness as well as the kinesthetic synchronization of human and robot arm motions during the handshake. The system is implemented using a lightweight anthropomorphic arm, with a Pisa/IIT Softhand wearing a sensorized silicone glove as the end-effector. The robotic arm is impedance-controlled, and its stiffness changes according to different laws under investigation. An internal observer is employed to synchronize the human and robot arm motions. Thus, we simulate both active and passive behavior of the robotic arm during the interaction. Using the system, studies are conducted where 20 participants are asked to interact with the robot, and then rate the perceived quality of the interaction using Likert scales. Our results show that the control of the robotic arm kinesthetic behavior does have an effect on the interaction with the robot, in term of its perceived personality traits, responsiveness, and human-likeness. Our results pave the way towards robotic systems that are capable of performing human–robot interactions in a more human-like manner, and with personality. © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Following its applications on reception, space exploration, health care, and others, the dual-arm robot is employed for industrial automation more intensively these days. With a human-like two-arm structure of high degrees of freedom, it should be a strong competitor for industrial tasks of high complexity. However, up to date, its deployment is still far behind the traditional single-arm robot manipulator. It may be partially due to its higher price and larger installation space. Meanwhile, the lack of proper methods or devices to deal with task planning and teaching that usually involves robot motions of more than 10 DOF is also influential. Motivated by it, in this paper, we propose a novel manipulation system for the industrial dual-arm robot manipulator using virtual reality (VR). Especially, we propose taking advantage of the similarity between the dual-arm robot and human arm and come up with a human-like path planner, with an intention to incorporate that of human into robot path planning. In addition, we also furnish the system with several assistive tools, including that for physical behavior emulation and self-collision detection. Simulations based on realistic environments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed manipulation system, along with the questionnaires to evaluate user's responses. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The human hand's versatility allows for robust and flexible grasping. To obtain such efficiency, many robotic hands include human biomechanical features such as fingers having their two last joints mechanically coupled. Although such coupling enables human-like grasping, controlling the inverse kinematics of such mechanical systems is challenging. Here we propose a cortical model for fine motor control of a humanoid finger, having its two last joints coupled, that learns the inverse kinematics of the effector. This neural model functionally mimics the population vector coding as well as sensorimotor prediction processes of the brain's motor/premotor and parietal regions, respectively. After learning, this neural architecture could both overtly (actual execution) and covertly (mental execution or motor imagery) perform accurate, robust and flexible finger movements while reproducing the main human finger kinematic states. This work contributes to developing neuro-mimetic controllers for dexterous humanoid robotic/prosthetic upper-extremities, and has the potential to promote human-robot interactions. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

A real operation using the assembly of an automotive starter motor is used as a case of study. Several patterns are generated and classified during the stages of the starter assembly. Three categories were considered during operations: moving both arms simultaneously and moving the right arm while keeping the left arm static and vice versa. Contact states were generated using the robot and learned by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Fuzzy ARTMAP architecture. The output of the ANN has been envisaged to be a motion command to diminish the constrained forces while moving the arm in the assembly direction. Results during contact state classification have shown that manipulative forces can be recognized by the Neural Network Controller (NNC) so that a valid motion command can be issued to the arm robot favoring the assembly task. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Biologically inspired robotic systems can find important applications in biomedical robotics, since studying and replicating human behaviour can provide new insights into motor recovery, functional substitution and human-robot interaction. The analysis of human hand motion is essential for collecting information about human hand movements useful for generalizing reaching and grasping actions on a robotic system. This paper focuses on the definition and extraction of quantitative indicators for describing optimal hand grasping postures and replicating them on an anthropomorphic robotic hand. A motion analysis has been carried out on six healthy human subjects performing a transverse volar grasp. The extracted indicators point to invariant grasping behaviours between the involved subjects, thus providing some constraints for identifying the optimal grasping configuration. Hence, an optimization algorithm based on the Nelder-Mead simplex method has been developed for determining the optimal grasp configuration of a robotic hand, grounded on the aforementioned constraints. It is characterized by a reduced computational cost.The grasp stability has been tested by introducing a quality index that satisfies the form-closure property. The grasping strategy has been validated by means of simulation tests and experimental trials on an arm-hand robotic system. The obtained results have shown the effectiveness of the extracted indicators to reduce the non-linear optimization problem complexity and lead to the synthesis of a grasping posture able to replicate the human behaviour while ensuring grasp stability. The experimental results have also highlighted the limitations of the adopted robotic platform (mainly due to the mechanical structure) to achieve the optimal grasp configuration. © 2014 The Author(s).},

In this bimodal controller, kinematic degrees of redundancy are adapted according to task-suitable dynamic costs.

Effectively reproducing such spatiotemporal feature of hand configuration trajectory in real time is essential to understand the human motor control and plan human-like motion on anthropomorphic robotic arm. However, there are no novel computational models in literature toward reproducing hand configuration-to-configuration movement in spatiotemporal profile. In response to the problem, this paper presents a computational framework for hand configuration trajectory formation based on hierarchical principle of human motor control. The composite potential field is constructed on special Euclidean Group to induce time-varying configuration toward target. The dynamic behavior of hand is described by a second-order kinematic model to produce the external representation of high-level motor control. The multivariate regression relation between intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates of arm, is statistically analyzed for determining the arm orientation in real time, which produces the external representation of low-level motor control. The proposed method is demonstrated in an anthropomorphic arm by performing several highly curved self-reaching movements. The generated configuration trajectories are compared with actual human movement in spatiotemporal profile to validate the proposed method. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the main functions of the human nervous system is the muscles control. The complexity of this function increases for hand and fingers control because of the high diversity and accuracy of the possible motions. Starting from the control mechanisms of the natural muscle we developed a structure of spiking neurons implemented in PCB hardware that is able to drive the elbow of a human-like robotic arm. In order to increase the biological plausibility of the designed robotic arm driving system, the artificial neural network controls artificial muscles that are implemented with Flexinol actuator wires. From our knowledge the control of the actuator wires using spiking neural networks was not performed previously. The results show that the excitatory spiking neurons are able to flex and straighten the artificial elbow by stimulating two antagonistic actuator wires. Moreover, by using inhibitory neurons that modulate the neural excitatory activity the arm mobile segment can be driven to specific positions. Our final goal is the development of a biologically plausible neural structure that is able to easily drive the hand and fingers of a human-like robotic arm by controlling the artificial muscles implemented with actuator wires. This will give important clues for future developments of spiking neural networks that drive robotic arms for performing complex tasks. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As humanoid robots start entering to the human beings environments, the collision between the robot and other objects is inevitable. To solve this problem, we propose the human mimicking push-recovery strategy. With the arm mechanism, the humanoid robot utilizes human-like strategies to deal with the unexpected collision. We analyse the human push-recovery movement to the external force. Thus we can design the trajectory generator to mimic human beings reactions. To reduce the modelling error and improve zmp stability, we utilizes the five-mass with angular momentum model as humanoid robot model. We design the safe bound examination and the Center of Mass (COM) state estimator to judge the collision stage. The safe bound examination is used to guarantee the walking stability. Moreover, the COM state estimator is used to determine whether the pushing is over or not. The push-recovery control system is implemented on the humanoid robot developed in our NTU-iCeiRA lab. The purpose of this paper aims to integrate different push-recovery strategies while encountering different collision conditions based on the five-mass with angular momentum model. © 2016 IEEE.},

A reasonable grasp formulation is also taken into account from the viewpoint of power grasping, where the grasp space of a humanoid robot finger is importantly considered to determine the phalangeal length parameters. The usefulness of the devised biomimetic optimization method is shown through the design examples of various humanoid robot fingers. In fact, the optimization-based finger design method enables us to determine effectively the proper phalangeal size of humanoid robot fingers for human-like object handling tasks.

Our method records the robot hand motions while teleoperated by human subjects via a dataglove, doing different grasp types on a series of objects. This exploits the fact that humans automatically compensate for calibration errors on the glove to robot mapping. The method is applied to the Shadow Robot Hand and to the iCub Hand. Despite the significantly different kinematics and different number and mechanism of actuators, the analysis results in useful postural synergies for both hands. The effective number of degrees-of-freedom to reproduce the recorded variance using the synergies is shown to be 2.6 for the different grasps, corresponding to a massive reduction of grasp-search complexity. Therefore, the existing actuators are enough to drive the hands with realistic human-like postures and in-hand movements. While previous work on synergies mostly concentrated on static grasping and power-grasps, our work confirms that human precision grasps and manipulation motions also lie on low-dimensional spaces. © 2013 IEEE.},

However, direct assignment of observed human motions to robot’s joints is not possible due to their physical differences. This paper presents a real-time inverse kinematics based human mimicking system to map human upper limbs motions to robot’s joints safely and smoothly. It considers both main definitions of motion similarity, between end-effector motions and between angular configurations. Microsoft Kinect sensor is used for natural perceiving of human motions. Additional constraints are proposed and solved in the projected null space of the Jacobian matrix. They consider not only the workspace and the valid motion ranges of the robot’s joints to avoid self-collisions, but also the similarity between the end-effector motions and the angular configurations to bring highly human-like motions to the robot. Performance of the proposed human mimicking system is quantitatively and qualitatively assessed and compared with the state-of-the-art methods in a human-robot interaction task using Nao humanoid robot. The results confirm applicability and ability of the proposed human mimicking system to properly mimic various human motions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

These balancing control methods effectively perform body posture control using three main motion strategies, namely: ankle, ankle-hip and stepping strategies. In this work we present a novel balance strategy which fundamentally differs from the previous methods as its principle is to exploit contacts with the environment to prevent falling rather than only performing body posture control. An uncoupled impedance controller for the upper body of the humanoid robot is combined with a lower body stabilizer, and the balancing capabilities are enhanced by the establishment of additional physical contacts with the environment. The generation of the reactive arm motion and the impedance regulation are discussed in details. Experimental trials with the humanoid robot COMAN, provided with active and passive compliance, demonstrate the potential of the approach and the first step towards the development of more human-like balancing skills using an integrated approach where all body parts (not only legs but also arms and hands) can establish contacts with the surrounding environment so as to ensure a stable and balanced behavior. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Background: Spinal-like regulators have recently been shown to support complex behavioral patterns during volitional goal-oriented reaching paradigms. We use an interpretation of the adaptive spinal-like controller as inspiration for the development of a controller for a robotic limb. It will be demonstrated that a simulated robot arm with linear actuators can achieve biological-like limb movements. In addition, it will be shown that programmability in the regulator enables independent spatial and temporal changes to be defined for movement tasks, downstream of central commands using sensory stimuli. The adaptive spinal-like controller is the first to demonstrate such behavior for complex motor behaviors in multi-joint limb movements. Methods: The controller is evaluated using a simulated robotic apparatus and three goal-oriented reaching paradigms: 1) shaping of trajectory profiles during reaching; 2) sensitivity of trajectories to sudden perturbations; 3) reaching to a moving target. The experiments were designed to highlight complex motor tasks that are omitted in earlier studies, and important for the development of improved artificial limb control. Results: In all three cases the controller was able to reach the targets without a priori planning of end-point or segmental motor trajectories. Instead, trajectory spatio-temporal dynamics evolve from properties of the controller architecture using the spatial error (vector distance to goal). Results show that curvature amplitude in hand trajectory paths are reduced by as much as 98% using simple gain scaling techniques, while adaptive network behavior allows the regulator to successfully adapt to perturbations and track a moving target. An important observation for this study is that all motions resemble human-like movements with non-linear muscles and complex joint mechanics. Conclusions: The controller shows that it can adapt to various behavioral contexts which are not included in previous biomimetic studies. The research supplements an earlier study by examining the tunability of the spinal-like controller for complex reaching tasks. This work is a step toward building more robust controllers for powered artificial limbs. © 2014 Stefanovic and Galiana; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {The brain must coordinate with redundant bodies to perform motion tasks. The aim of the present study is to propose a novel control model that predicts the characteristics of human joint coordination at a behavioral level. To evaluate the joint coordination, an uncontrolled manifold (UCM) analysis that focuses on the trial-to-trial variance of joints has been proposed. The UCM is a nonlinear manifold associated with redundant kinematics. In this study, we directly applied the notion of the UCM to our proposed control model called the “UCM reference feedback control.” To simplify the problem, the present study considered how the redundant joints were controlled to regulate a given target hand position. We considered a conventional method that pre-determined a unique target joint trajectory by inverse kinematics or any other optimization method. In contrast, our proposed control method generates a UCM as a control target at each time step. The target UCM is a subspace of joint angles whose variability does not affect the hand position. The joint combination in the target UCM is then selected so as to minimize the cost function, which consisted of the joint torque and torque change. To examine whether the proposed method could reproduce human-like joint coordination, we conducted simulation and measurement experiments. In the simulation experiments, a three-link arm with a shoulder, elbow, and wrist regulates a one-dimensional target of a hand through proposed method. In the measurement experiments, subjects performed a one-dimensional target-tracking task. The kinematics, dynamics, and joint coordination were quantitatively compared with the simulation data of the proposed method. As a result, the UCM reference feedback control could quantitatively reproduce the difference of the mean value for the end hand position between the initial postures, the peaks of the bell-shape tangential hand velocity, the sum of the squared torque, the mean value for the torque change, the variance components, and the index of synergy as well as the human subjects. We concluded that UCM reference feedback control can reproduce human-like joint coordination. The inference for motor control of the human central nervous system based on the proposed method was discussed. © 2016 Togo, Kagawa and Uno.},

We asked people to sort and cluster different action-painting images and performed PCA and Cluster Analysis in order to determine image traits that cause certain aesthetic experiences in contemplators.

	abstract = {Of particular interest to the neuroscience and robotics communities is the understanding of how two humans could physically collaborate to perform motor tasks such as holding a tool or moving it across locations. When two humans physically interact with each other, sensory consequences and motor outcomes are not entirely predictable as they also depend on the other agent's actions. The sensory mechanisms involved in physical interactions are not well understood. The present study was designed (1) to quantify human-human physical interactions where one agent ("follower") has to infer the intended or imagined-but not executed-direction of motion of another agent ("leader") and (2) to reveal the underlying strategies used by the dyad. This study also aimed at verifying the extent to which visual feedback (VF) is necessary for communicating intended movement direction. We found that the control of leader on the relationship between force and motion was a critical factor in conveying his/her intended movement direction to the follower regardless of VF of the grasped handle or the arms. Interestingly, the dyad's ability to communicate and infer movement direction with significant accuracy improved (>83%) after a relatively short amount of practice. These results indicate that the relationship between force and motion (interpreting as arm impedance modulation) may represent an important means for communicating intended movement direction between biological agents, as indicated by the modulation of this relationship to intended direction. Ongoing work is investigating the application of the present findings to optimize communication of high-level movement goals during physical interactions between biological and non-biological agents. © 2017 Mojtahedi, Whitsell, Artemiadis and Santello.},

Most of them, however, look for optimality according to some metrics, but have no biological inspiration or cannot be used to imitate biological motion. For a human these techniques behave in a non-naturalistic way. This poses a problem for instance in human-robot interaction and, in general, for a good acceptance of robots in society. The present work presents a new analysis of the attractor dynamics approach to movement generation used in an anthropomorphic robot arm. Our analysis points to the possibility of using this approach to generate human-like arm trajectories in robots. One key property of human trajectories in pick-and-place tasks is the planarity of the trajectory of the end effector in 3D space. We show that this feature is also displayed by the attractor dynamic approach and, therefore, is a good candidate to the generation of naturalistic arm movements. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Implementation of a task using a redundant robot arm requires a solution of the inverse differential kinematic problem. Previous algorithms for this problem used various optimized objective functions to limit null space motion. The problem with using an objective function is that the weight needs to be adjusted according to the type of operation. Since the order of the objective function is lower than that of the kinematic constraints using a pseudo inverse, it is hard to predict null space motion for a repetitive task. This type of problem is said to be manually controlled by the objective function. In this study, we introduce a matrix augmentation method so that active control of the null space motion can be implemented. We use the normal vector of the plane defined by the wrist, elbow and shoulder points and the reference vector Pw-Ps as the control criterion, and we define the output angle between these two vectors. In addition, the saturation method is used to prevent violation of the joint angle limit constraints. A simulation and an experiment using a 7-DOF robot arm were carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. For the simulation, we used Matlab to generate the null space motion, and we used a 7-DOF robot arm developed in our lab to verify the proposed method experimentally. The proposed algorithm allows redundancy resolution, since intuitive and predictable null space motion can be generated according to a desired output angle. © 2014 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

	abstract = {Human environments possess a significant amount of underlying structure that is under-utilized in motion planning and mobile manipulation. In domestic environments for example, walls and shelves are static, large objects such as furniture and kitchen appliances most of the time do not move and do not change, and objects are typically placed on a limited number of support surfaces such as tables, countertops or shelves. Motion planning for robots operating in such environments should be able to exploit this structure to improve its performance with each execution of a task. In this paper, we develop an online motion planning approach which learns from its planning episodes (experiences) a graph, an Experience Graph. This graph represents the underlying connectivity of the space required for the execution of the mundane tasks performed by the robot. The planner uses the Experience graph to accelerate its planning efforts whenever possible. On the theoretical side, we show that planning with Experience graphs is complete and provides bounds on sub-optimality with respect to the graph that represents the original planning problem. On the experimental side, we show in simulations and on a physical robot that our approach is particularly suitable for higher-dimensional motion planning tasks such as planning for single-Arm manipulation and two armed mobile manipulation. The approach provides significant speedups over planning from scratch and generates predictable motion plans: motions planned from start positions that are close to each other to goal positions that are also close to each other tend to be similar. In addition, we show how the Experience graphs can incorporate solutions from other approaches such as human demonstrations, providing an easy way of bootstrapping motion planning for complex tasks. © 2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

In this work, relying on the observations on human bimanual coordination, a novel realtime motion control strategy is proposed to regulate the desired Cartesian stiffness profile during the execution of bimanual tasks. The novelty of the proposed control scheme relies on the use of common mode stiffness (CMS) and configuration dependent stiffness (CDS) to regulate the size and directionality of the task space stiffness ellipsoid. Thanks to the CDS control, the proposed scheme is not only proved to be effective in regulating the desired stiffness ellipsoid but also permits to resolve the manipulator redundancy in a natural manner. The effectiveness of the controller is evaluated in an experimental setup in which two cooperating robotic arms are executing an assembly task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-arm CDS-CMS controller is effective in tracking the desired stiffness ellipsoids as well as in producing human-like natural motions for the two robotic arms. © 2014 IEEE.},

We introduce the notion of inverse legibility in which the human-generated actions are legible enough for the robot to infer the human intent confidently and accurately. The proposed disambiguation paradigm seeks to elicit legible control commands from the human by selecting control modes, for the robotic arm, in which human-directed motion will maximally disambiguate between multiple goals. We present simulation results which look into the robustness of our algorithm and the impact of the choice of confidence functions on the performance of the system. Our simulations results suggest that the choice of confidence function is a critical factor in determining the disambiguation algorithm's capability to capture human intent.

These two factors motivate intrinsic compliance modulation in robots interacting with humans. Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) allow for simultaneous position and stiffness control of a joint, therefore they have been implemented in the realization of intrinsically compliant and high performance robot arms. Most applications employ VSAs in a monoarticular structure, that is one actuator produces torque about one joint. In the biological world however, bi-articular muscles (muscles spanning two joints) play a fundamental role in motion control for humans, not only reducing link inertia, but also increasing isotropy of end effector force and compliance. In this work, a robot arm with VSAs and two interchangeable actuation structures (the traditional monoarticular and human-like biarticular) is built. The end effector intrinsic compliance in both the actuation structures is measured. Experimental results suggest that the biarticular VSA structure is more suitable for compliant robot arms. © IFAC.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a state-of-art reinforcement learning strategy to enable a human-like dual arm mobile robot to deal with some complicated tasks with dual arm cooperation. A complex movement task of robot can be divided into action phases and subgoals, each of which corresponds to a dynamic motion primitive (DMP). During control of the humanoid-like dual arm mobile robot, there are some noises that affect the precision of the movement of the robot. To deal with those uncertain perturbations while handling varying manipulation dynamics for grasping motion, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with sequences of dynamical motion primitives strategy is proposed in this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a two-phase planning has been considered in the experiment, namely, the online redundancy resolution based on the neural-dynamic optimization algorithm to obtain the initial joint trajectories on the first trial, and the reinforcement learning of DMP in the learning process, where DMP is used to model the joint trajectories, and then reinforcement learning is employed to adjust the model to suppress uncertain perturbations. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {At present, industrial robot arms have been widely applied in actual production. Especially for some human-robot cooperation work scenarios, involving the interaction between human and robot in sharing workspace, the requirement of trajectory planning for safety and natural interaction was more demanded. Aiming to solve the problems of the complex planning of trajectory and low security of man-machine cooperation, this paper introduced a control method of human-like trajectory based on the k-nearest neighbors. By using the Kinect equipment, the trajectories of wrist joint of human arm were acquired during manipulation tasks and then the k-nearest neighbors algorithm was adopted to analyze the trajectories. Consequently, the control laws of human-like trajectory of robot end-effecter are extracted based on the collected motion data. The corresponding experiments are conducted to verify the proposed method and this method can generate the human-like trajectory for robot manipulators, avoiding the collision with human arm and obstacles. It also enhances the performance of security and makes robots more human-robot friendly. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Reach-to-grasp arm postures differ from those in pure reaching because they are affected by grasp position/orientation, rather than simple transport to a position during a reaching motion. This paper investigates this difference via an analysis of experimental data collected on reaching and reach-to-grasp motions. A seven-degree-of-freedom (DOFs) kinematic arm model with the swivel angle is used for the motion analysis. Compared to a widely used anatomical arm model, this model distinguishes clearly the four grasping-relevant DOFs (GR-DOFs) that are affected by positions and orientations of the objects to be grasped. These four GR-DOFs include the swivel angle that measures the elbow rotation about the shoulder–wrist axis, and three wrist joint angles. For each GR-DOF, we quantify position vs orientation task-relevance bias that measures how much the DOF is affected by the grasping position vs orientation. The swivel angle and forearm supination have similar bias, and the analysis of their motion suggests two hypotheses regarding the synergistic coordination of the macro- and micro-structures of the human arm (1) DOFs with similar task-relevance are synergistically coordinated; and (2) such synergy breaks when a task-relevant DOF is close to its joint limit without necessarily reaching the limit. This study provides a motion analysis method to reduce the control complexity for reach-to-grasp tasks, and suggests using dynamic coupling to coordinate the hand and arm of upper-limb exoskeletons. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of designing a planning algorithm for anthropomorphic dual-arm robotic systems to find paths that mimics the movements of real human beings by using first-order synergies (correlations between joint velocities). The key idea of the proposal is to convert captured human movements into a vector field of velocities, defined in the configuration space of the robot, and use it to guide the search of a solution path. The motion planning is solved using the proposed algorithm, called FOS-BKPIECE, that is a bidirectional version of the KPIECE planner working with an improved version of the extension procedure of the VF-RRT planner. The obtained robot movements follow the directions of the defined vector field and hence allow the robot to solve the task in a human-like fashion. The paper presents a description of the proposed approach as well as results from conceptual and application examples, the latter using a real anthropomorphic dual-arm robotic system. A thorough comparison with other previous planning algorithms shows that the proposed approach obtains better results. © 2017},

	abstract = {The body representation in the human mind is dynamic, and illusions or traumatic events can modify it to include additional limbs. This remarkable adaptability of the central nervous system to different body configurations opens new possibilities in the field of human augmentation. In order to fully exploit this potential, we developed a new type of wearable co-robot that can perform tasks in close coordination with the human user. The system, named Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), consists of two additional robotic arms worn through a backpack-like harness. The SRL can assist the user by holding objects, lifting weights and streamlining the execution of a task. If the SRL perform movements closely coordinated with the user and exhibit human-like dynamics, they might be incorporated into the body representation and perceived as parts of the user's body. As a result, the human would be able to extend the range of available skills and manipulation possibilities, performing tasks more effectively and with less effort. This paper presents a communication, estimation and control method for the SRL, aimed to perform tasks in tight coordination with the wearer. The SRL observes the user motion, and actively assists the human by employing a coordinated control algorithm. In particular, skills involving the direct cooperation of two human workers are transferred to the SRL and a single user. Demonstration data of the two humans - a leader and an assistant - are analyzed and a state estimation algorithm is extracted from them. This can be used to control the SRL accordingly with the used end effectors. A causal relationship relating the assistant's motion to the leader's motion is identified based on System Identification methods. This approach is applied to a drilling operation performed by two workers. An effective coordination skill is identified and transferred to the SRL, to make them act like the human follower. © 2012 IEEE.},

To enable this capability in a humanoid robot, the robot should have human-like mass, a center of mass position, and inertial moment of each link. To mimic this characteristic, we developed an angular momentum control method using a humanoid upper body based on human motion. In this method, the angular momentum generated by the movement of the humanoid lower body is calculated, and the torso and arm motions are calculated to compensate for the angular momentum of the lower body. We additionally developed the humanoid upper-body mechanism that mimics the human link length and mass property by using carbon fiber reinforced plastic and a symmetric structure. As a result, the developed humanoid robot could generate almost the same angular momentum as that of human through human-like running motion. Furthermore, when suspended in midair, the humanoid robot produced the angular momentum compensation in the yaw direction. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces, it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function which 'explains' the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example trajectories from two participants performing a collaborative assembly task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict a human's motion for a given task by iteratively replanning a trajectory for a 23 DoF human kinematic model using the STOMP algorithm with the learned cost function in the presence of a moving collaborator. Our results suggest that our method outperforms baseline methods and generalizes well for tasks similar to those that were demonstrated. © 2015 IEEE.},

The motivation for this study is inspired from the observation of human motion in their daily activities. Two reflex actions are proposed in this work. The first reflex is designed to control the COM of the robot when its stability is endangered by the effect of the object weight. Static stability criterion is used to observe this dangerous effect and a simple minimization technique is used to generate the reflex torque. The second reflex aims to reduce the consumed torque of the motors by simply finding a pose at which the gravity term minimized. A control law is suggested for a dual arm robot to perform picking motion for both two cases with known and unknown objects. The control state space is the operational space and no inverse kinematics are needed. Finally, several dynamic simulations are introduced to validate the efficiency of the proposed controller. © 2014 IEEE.},

At the level of action plan, the patient's intention is decoded by means of an active vision system, through the combination of a Kinect-based vision system, which can online robustly identify and track 3-D objects, and an eye-tracking system for objects selection. At the level of action generation, a BCI is used to control the patient's intention to move his/her own arm, on the basis of brain activity analyzed during motor imagery. The main kinematic parameters of the reaching movement (i.e., speed, acceleration, and jerk) assisted by the robot are modulated by the output of the BCI classifier so that the robot-assisted movement is performed under a continuous control of patient's brain activity. The system was experimentally evaluated in a group of three healthy volunteers and four chronic stroke patients. Experimental results show that all subjects were able to operate the exoskeleton movement by BCI with a classification error rate of 89.4 ± 5.0% in the robot-assisted condition, with no difference of the performance observed in stroke patients compared with healthy subjects. This indicates the high potential of the proposed gaze-BCI-driven robotic assistance for neurorehabilitation of patients with motor impairments after stroke since the earliest phase of recovery. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

Two sub-problems are studied: The determination of the final target position (where the robot should hand over the object to) and the generation of human-like motion in the hand-over process (how the robot should hand over the object to the position). First, experiments of different subjects are conducted to explore the common characteristics in the optimal hand-over positions. The result shows that their joint angles are similar at the optimal hand-over position. Therefore, the optimal hand-over position can be determined by forward kinematics based on the measured average joint angles. Then, two methods are proposed to plan the human-like hand-over motions in an obstacle-free environment and in an obstacle-present environment, respectively. A series of experimental comparisons is conducted to prove the validity of the methods. A robotic arm is controlled to hand over a cube to humans in human-like way and nonhuman-like way. The subjects are asked to grade the hand-over motion of the robotic arm on a scale of 1 to 5. The results show that the hand-over motions planned by the methods proposed in this paper can make people feel safer and more comfortable. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

Human-like motion is one of those important issues, especially for humanoid service robots, advanced industrial robots and assistive robots. In this paper, a motion-decision algorithm is proposed and applied to human-like motion planning of robotic arms. The algorithm consists of two parts: intelligent decision and calculation of the joint trajectory. The former includes two parts: the hierarchical planning strategy (HPS) and the Bayesian decision. The HPS reflects the general rules of human arm movements and the robotic arms using the HPS can simulate the movements of human arms accurately. The Bayesian decision is used to make robotic arms choose an appropriate mode of motion. The calculation of the joint trajectory builds a motion framework of robotic arms to generate human-like movements. The human performance measures (HPMs) in different planning hierarchies are proposed. Finally, the validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We build the robot dynamics and propose humanlike learning control using low-feedback gains and sEMG biofeedback for the exoskeleton such that it can flexibly interact with different human users. Due to the harmonic drive transmission (HDT) of the exoskeleton, its motion is precise for co-manipulation tasks of human and robot because of its backdrivability, precise positioning capabilities, and zero backlash. However, it is challenging for making the development of an accurate dynamic model of the robot extremely because of the compliance and oscillations inherent in harmonic drive systems, and the lack of any technical information on the internal dynamics of the transmission. Moreover, it's impossible to get a precise human arm model for each user. The novelty of this work lies in the development of rehabilitation robot and extracting the model parameters of a harmonic drive transmission in the robot, together with human-like learning control and sEMG bio-feedback, to facilitate co-manipulation task.

	abstract = {Coordinated control strategies for multi-robot systems are necessary for tasks that cannot be executed by a single robot. This encompasses tasks where the workspace of the robot is too small or where the load is too heavy for one robot to handle. Using multiple robots makes the task feasible by extending the workspace and/or increase the payload of the overall robotic system. In this paper, we consider two instances of such tasks: a co-worker scenario in which a human hands over a large object to a robot; intercepting a large flying object. The problem is made difficult as the pick-up/intercept motions must take place while the object is in motion and because the object's motion is not deterministic. The challenge is then to adapt the motion of the robotic arms in coordination with one another and with the object. Determining the pick-up/intercept point is done by taking into account the workspace of the multi-arm system. The point is continuously recomputed to adapt to change in the object's trajectory. We propose a virtual object based dynamical systems (DS) control law to generate autonomous and synchronized motions for a multi-arm robot system. We show theoretically that the multi-arm + virtual object system converges asymptotically to the moving object. We validate our approach on a dual-arm robotic system and demonstrate that it can resynchronize and adapt the motion of each arm in a fraction of a second, even when the motion of the object is fast and not accurately predictable. ©2018 MIT Press Journals.

	abstract = {To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces, it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function that 'explains' the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example trajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative assembly task using motion capture. We then use inverse optimal control to learn a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict reaching motions from the human's current configuration to a task-space goal region by iteratively replanning a trajectory using the learned cost function. Our planning algorithm is based on the trajectory optimizer: stochastic trajectory optimizer for motion planning [1]; it plans for a 23-degree-of-freedom human kinematic model and accounts for the presence of a moving collaborator and obstacles in the environment. Our results suggest that in most cases, our method outperforms baseline methods when predicting motions. We also show that our method outperforms baselines for predicting human motion when a human and a robot share the workspace. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Imitation learning is an efficient framework that allows anthropomorphic robotic arms to synthesize human like movements. However, the synthesis of the exactly same movements as learned ones is not helpful in real environments since the environments are different from the one where the movements were learned. For instance, a robotic arm learns the movement of manipulating an object by observing a human manipulating the object. This movement that is precisely same as learned one cannot be reused in the new situations since the the locations of the object are varied. Therefore, synthesis of a movement that not only looks natural and but also is adaptive to the new environment is necessary for the anthropomorphic robotic arm that completes a specific task. This paper describes a novel approach to synthesizing natural movements for the anthropomorphic robotic arm based on the maintained demonstrations given by its human partners. The anthropomorphic robotic arm is trained through kinesthetic demonstrations by its human partner, encodes the demonstrations into stochastic models, and synthesizes new movements dependent on the current environment. The proposed approach designs the objective function which evaluates the similarity between the synthesized movement and maintained demonstration, and the satisfaction of being kinematically constrained to the environment. The movement that maximizes this objective function can be found, and consequently the anthropomorphic robotic arm can reproduce the adaptive movement to the current environment such that it can accomplish a specific task. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework enabling navigational autonomy for a mobile platform with application scenarios specifically requiring a humanoid telepresence system. The proposal promises a reduced operator workload and safety during robot motion. In addition, the framework enables the inhabitor (human controlling the platform) to provide inputs for head and arm gesticulation. This allows the inhabitor to focus on interactions at the remote environment, rather than being engrossed in controlling robot navigation. This paper discusses the development of higher-level, human-like navigational behaviors such as following, accompanying, and guiding a person autonomously. A color histogram comparison and position matching algorithm has been developed to track the person using the Kinect sensors. In addition to providing a safe and easy-to-use system, the high-level behaviors are also required to be human-like in that the mobile platform obeys the laws of proxemics and other human interaction norms such as walking speed. This facilitates a higher level of experience for other humans interacting with the robotic platform. An obstacle avoidance function has also been implemented using the virtual potential field method. A preliminary evaluation was also conducted to validate the algorithm and to support the claim of reducing operator cognitive load due to navigation. In general, it was shown that navigation over a given route was accomplished at a faster pace with no instances of collision with the environment. © 2014 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

In this paper, we focus on a 4-DOF anthropomorphic arm and propose a novel approach to generate human-like motion, considering human physiological and psychological factors. According to the features of musculoskeletal system of human upper limb, the 3-DOF shoulder joint is simplified with two rotations: one is about a fixed axis through shoulder center and the other is about the axis of humerus. In addition with elbow joint and a special rotation about the shoulder-wrist line, they constitute the basic motion primitives (MPs) which are macroscopic compared with the joint space but microscopic compared with the Cartesian space. Therefore, planning motion based on MPs combines intuitiveness and flexibility. Two basic kinds of motion planning, point-to-point motion planning and linear trajectory planning, are conducted. The different psychological concerns, i.e., predicting the next step of configuration and relieving the brain burden, are taken into account. Simulations are performed to verify the feasibility and validation of the proposed approach. Comparisons between simulation results with the proposed method and that with traditional joint and Cartesian space methods prove the improvement in human-likeness. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {The robot manipulation in human environment is a challenging issue because the human environment is complex, dynamic, unstructured, and difficult to perceive reliably. In order to implement promising robot applications in our daily lives, robots need to perform manipulation tasks within human environment. Particularly for a humanoid robot, the manipulability of the objects is essential to assist the humans in human environment. This paper presents a method for manipulating an object with both arms of a humanoid robot. We focus on the generation of human-like movements by using the human motion capture data. Then, the control method based on the virtual dynamics model is proposed to control both the motion and force under the uniform control system. This method empowers the robot to perform the object manipulation task including reaching, grasping, and moving an object in sequence. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a humanoid robot with independent joint controller at each motor; its performance is demonstrated by manipulating an object with both arms. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Intrinsic motivation is one of the keys in implementing the mechanism of interest to robots. In this paper, we present a method to apply intrinsic motivation in dynamics learning with predictable and unpredictable targets in view. The robots arm is used for the predictable target and the humans arm is used for the unpredictable target in the experiment. The learning algorithm based on intrinsic motivation will automatically set a larger weight to targets that would contribute to decreasing the training error, while setting a smaller weight to others. A neurodynamical model, namely multiple timescales recurrent neural network (MTRNN), is utilized for studying the robots arm/external object dynamics. Training of MTRNN is done using the back propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. We modify the BPTT algorithm by the following two steps. (1) Evaluate predictability of robots arm/objects using training error of MTRNN. (2) Assign a preference ratio, which represents the weight of the training, to each object based on predictability. The proposed training method would focus more on reducing training error of predictable objects compared to normal BPTT, where training error is equally treated for every object. Experiments were conducted using an actual robot platform, moving the robots arm while a human moves his arm in the robots camera view. The results of the experiment showed that the proposed training method could achieve smaller training error of the robots arm visuomotor dynamics, which is predictable from the robots motor command, compared to general training with BPTT. Evaluation of MTRNN as a forward model to predict untrained data showed that the proposed model is capable of predicting the robots hand motion, specifically with larger number of nodes. © 2015 Taylor and Francis and The Robotics Society of Japan.},

	abstract = {Heuristic searches such as the A search are a popular means of finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical guarantees on completeness and optimality, simplicity in implementation and consistent behavior. In planning for robotic manipulation, however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based approach to motion planning for manipulation that does deal effectively with the high dimensionality of the problem. Our approach achieves the necessary efficiency by exploiting the following three key principles: (a) representation of the planning problem with what we call a manipulation lattice graph; (b) use of the ARA search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality; and (c) use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics. The paper presents the approach together with its theoretical properties and shows how to apply it to single-arm and dual-arm motion planning with upright constraints on a PR2 robot operating in non-trivial cluttered spaces. An extensive experimental analysis in both simulation and on a physical PR2 shows that, in terms of runtime, our approach is on a par with other most common sampling-based approaches despite the high dimensionality of the problems. In addition, the experimental analysis shows that due to its deterministic cost minimization, the approach generates motions that are of good quality and are consistent, in other words, the resulting plans tend to be similar for similar tasks. For many problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human controlling or interacting with the robot. © The Author(s) 2013.},

This paper proposes an integral sliding mode controller (ISMC) based compliance control scheme for the Bristol Robotics Laboratorys humanoid BERT II robot arm. Apart from introducing a model reference compliance controller, the ISMC scheme is aimed to deal with the robot arm dynamic models inaccuracies and un-modelled nonlinearities. The control scheme consists of a feedback linearization (FL) and an ISMC part. In addition, a posture controller has been incorporated to employ the redundant DOF and generate human like motion. The desired level of compliance can be tuned by selecting the stiffness and damping parameters in the sliding mode variable (compliance reference model). The results show that the compliant control is feasible at different levels for BERT II in simulation and experiment. The positioning control has been satisfactorily achieved and nonlinearities and un-modelled dynamics have been successfully overcome. © Author(s) 2016. CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

	abstract = {Dexterity robotic hands can (Cummings, 1996) greatly enhance the functionality of humanoid robots, but the making of such hands with not only human-like appearance but also the capability of performing the natural movement of social robots is a challenging problem. The first challenge is to create the hand's articulated structure and the second challenge is to actuate it to move like a human hand. A robotic hand for humanoid robot should look and behave human like. At the same time, it also needs to be light and cheap for widely used purposes. We start with studying the biomechanical features of a human hand and propose a simplified mechanical model of robotic hands, which can achieve the important local motions of the hand. Then, we use 3D modeling techniques to create a single interlocked hand model that integrates pin and ball joints to our hand model. Compared to other robotic hands, our design saves the time required for assembling and adjusting, which makes our robotic hand ready-to-use right after the 3D printing is completed. Finally, the actuation of the hand is realized by cables and motors. Based on this approach, we have designed a cost-effective, 3D printable, compact, and lightweight robotic hand. Our robotic hand weighs 150 g, has 15 joints, which are similar to a real human hand, and 6 Degree of Freedom (DOFs). It is actuated by only six small size actuators. The wrist connecting part is also integrated into the hand model and could be customized for different robots such as Nadine robot (Magnenat Thalmann et al., 2017). The compact servo bed can be hidden inside the Nadine robot's sleeve and the whole robotic hand platform will not cause extra load to her arm as the total weight (150 g robotic hand and 162 g artificial skin) is almost the same as her previous unarticulated robotic hand which is 348 g. The paper also shows our test results with and without silicon artificial hand skin, and on Nadine robot. © 2017 Tian, Magnenat Thalmann, Thalmann and Zheng.},

	abstract = {The design of finger pads for robotic and prosthetic hands is often overlooked, with relatively simple shapes and mechanical properties typically used. The finger pad geometry and mechanical properties are especially important for within-hand dexterous manipulation, and human finger usage patterns suggest extending robotic finger pad usage onto side surfaces could enable a wider range of manipulation motion. In this work, we propose a novel finger pad design that combines a ridged stiff inner structure with air gaps and a flexible outer skin to facilitate both grasp stability and versatile usage of the finger surface. The air gaps enable objects to displace the outer skin and stably settle between two adjacent ridges. During manipulation, the ridges can also serve as predictable pivot points. Experimental results comparing three ridged finger designs to a conventional solid core design show that the ridged designs consistently outperform the reference solid core design for all objects, in terms of the ability to stably manipulate objects through a large motion range without ejection (losing grip on the object). Designs with larger spaces between ridges performed better overall than designs with closer spacing, showing that larger 'wells' allow objects to more stably settle into the space between ridges. We anticipate the novel finger pad designs and the analysis of their behavior will inform future robotic hand designs, especially designs which aim to incorporate side finger usage. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recently, significant advances have been made in ROBOTICS, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and other COGNITIVE related fields, allowing to make much sophisticated biomimetic robotics systems. In addition, enormous number of robots have been designed and assembled, explicitly realize biological oriented behaviors. Towards much skill behaviors and adequate grasping abilities (i.e. ARTICULATION and DEXTEROUS MANIPULATION), a new phase of dexterous hands have been developed recently with biomimetically oriented and bio-inspired functionalities. In this respect, this manuscript brings a detailed survey of biomimetic based dexterous robotics multi-fingered hands. The aim of this survey, is to find out the state of the art on dexterous robotics end-effectors, known in literature as (ROBOTIC HANDS) or (DEXTEROUS MULTI-FINGERED) robot hands. Hence, this review finds such biomimetic approaches using a framework that permits for a common description of biological and technical based hand manipulation behavior. In particular, the manuscript focuses on a number of developments that have been taking place over the past two decades, and some recent developments related to this biomimetic field of research. In conclusions, the study found that, there are rich research efforts in terms of KINEMATICS, DYNAMICS, MODELING and CONTROL methodologies. The survey is also indicating that, the topic of biomimetic inspired robotics systems make significant contributions to robotics hand design, in four main directions for future research. First, they provide a genuine world test of models of biologically inspired hand designs and dexterous manipulation behaviors. Second, they provide novel manipulation articulations and mechanisms available for industrial and domestic uses, most notably in the field of human like hand design and real world applications. Third, this survey has also indicated that, there are quite large number of attempts to acquire biologically inspired hands. These attempts were almost successful, where they exposed more novel ideas for further developments. Such inspirations were directed towards a number of topics related (HAND MECHANICS AND DESIGN), (HAND TACTILE SENSING), (HAND FORCE SENSING), (HAND SOFT ACTUATION) and (HAND CONFIGURATION AND TOPOLOGY). FOURTH, in terms of employing AI related sciences and cognitive thinking, it was also found that, rare and exceptional research attempts were directed towards the employment of biologically inspired thinking, i.e. (AI, BRAIN AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES) for hand upper control and towards much sophisticated dexterous movements. Throughout the study, it has been found there are number of efforts in terms of mechanics and hand designs, tactical sensing, however, for hand soft actuation, it seems this area of research is still far away from having a realistic muscular type fingers and hand movements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In the field of human motor control, the motor synergy hypothesis explains how humans simplify body control dimensionality by coordinating groups of muscles, called motor synergies, instead of controlling muscles independently. In most applications of motor synergies to low-dimensional control in robotics, motor synergies are extracted from given optimal control signals. In this paper, we address the problems of how to extract motor synergies without optimal data given, and how to apply motor synergies to achieve low-dimensional task-space tracking control of a human-like robotic arm actuated by redundant muscles, without prior knowledge of the robot. We propose to extract motor synergies from a subset of randomly generated reaching-like movement data. The essence is to first approximate the corresponding optimal control signals, using estimations of the robot's forward dynamics, and to extract the motor synergies subsequently. In order to avoid modeling difficulties, a learning-based control approach is adopted such that control is accomplished via estimations of the robot's inverse dynamics. We present a kernel-based regression formulation to estimate the forward and the inverse dynamics, and a sliding controller in order to cope with estimation error. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed method enables extraction of motor synergies for low-dimensional task-space control. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Medical robots are increasingly being used to assist surgeons during procedures requiring precision. As reported in the literature, surgeons have been opting for minimally invasive surgery, as it reduces patient complications, overall patient recovery time, and hospital time for the patient. Robotic manipulators can be used to overcome natural limitations related to vision and human dexterity, and allow surgeons to transcend these limitations without having to sacrifice improvement in patient outcome. A desirable attribute of surgical robots is maneuverability similar to the human arm. The KUKA DLR Lightweight Robot Arm (LWR), with seven degrees of freedom, retains many of these human-like dexterity traits. Due to the KUKA robot arms maneuverability and flexibility, it is well-suited for intricate tasks based upon motion analyses and modeling of the compliance to path trajectory in addition to the overall smoothness of the path. This robot may be further programmed to be effective and precise for surgical applications. In the studies reported here, a unique Rapidly exploring Randomized Tree (RRT) based path-planning algorithm is developed and this algorithm is used to generate path plans between an initial state and a goal state for simulated models of robotic manipulator arms. Along with constraints, the RRT algorithm has been implemented to find paths for the chosen kinematic or dynamic robotic manipulator arm. Similar techniques are to be used to analyze the KUKA LWR IV+ system. Motion analyses have been carried out with consideration Address all correspondence to this author. of motion trajectories and all possible locations of the end effector with unique constraints applied to the system. In these simulations, the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters were recorded, with special attention to movement restrictions. The results of the RRT paths generation, analysis of the manipulator arm trajectories, and simulations allow one to better determine the location of the end-effector at any given point in time and location. From this foundation, the generation of path-planning restrictions for the KUKA robots path programming is expected to take into account surgically restricted dangerous or undesirable zones. In future work, the trajectories of the KUKA robot and other manipulator arms are to be compared with the data available in the literature. This work holds promising implications for the improved use of such robot systems in surgical applications. For example, precise pre-programmed robotic movements are expected to be particularly helpful for surgeries in tight, anatomically restricted sites, with adjacent delicate tissues. Ultimately, it is expected that this type of novel robotic application will greatly aid surgeons in improving the precision and safety of surgical procedures, by reducing potential complications and minimizing potential nicks and tears, and working towards giving the surgeons the same ease that they have with traditional surgery.

However, controlling a robot by gestures and body postures is a simple method that offers a simpler and direct approach to perform these human-like tasks.

Based on the DMP representation, reinforcement learning based methods are adopted to learn DMP shape and goal parameters, aiming at not only deriving suitable arm joint trajectories satisfying certain constraints such as energy-saving and collision-free, but also enabling the robot to find goal configurations without complicated inverse kinematics calculations.

	abstract = {As robots are increasingly used in human-cluttered environments, the requirement of human-likeness in their movements becomes essential. Although robots perform a wide variety of demanding tasks around the world in factories, remote sites and dangerous environments, they are still lacking the ability to coordinate with humans in simple, every-day life bi-manual tasks, e.g. removing a jar lid. This paper focuses on the introduction of bio-inspired control schemes for robot arms that coordinate with human arms in bi-manual manipulation tasks. Using data captured from human subjects performing a variety of every-day bi-manual life tasks, we propose a bio-inspired controller for a robot arm, that is able to learn human inter- and intra-arm coordination during those tasks. We embed human arm coordination in low-dimension manifolds, and build potential fields that attract the robot to human-like configurations using the probability distributions of the recorded human data. The method is tested using a simulated robot arm that is identical in structure to the human arm. A preliminary evaluation of the approach is also carried out using an anthropomorphic robot arm in bi-manual manipulation task with a human subject. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

	abstract = {It is a common belief that service robots shall move in a human-like manner to enable natural and convenient interaction with a human user or collaborator. In particular, this applies to anthropomorphic 7-DOF redundant robot manipulators that have a shoulder-elbow-wrist configuration. On the kinematic level, human-like movement then can be realized by means of selecting a redundancy resolution for the inverse kinematics (IK), which realizes human-like movement through respective nullspace preferences. In this paper, key positions are introduced and defined as Cartesian positions of the manipulator’s elbow and wrist joints. The key positions are used as constraints on the inverse kinematics in addition to orientation constraints at the end-effector, such that the inverse kinematics can be calculated through an efficient analytical scheme and realizes human-like configurations. To obtain suitable key positions, a correspondence method named wrist-elbow-in-line is derived to map key positions of human demonstrations to the real robot for obtaining a valid analytical inverse kinematics solution. A human demonstration tracking experiment is conducted to evaluate the end-effector accuracy and human-likeness of the generated motion for a 7-DOF Kuka-LWR arm. The results are compared to a similar correspondance method that emphasizes only the wrist postion and show that the subtle differences between the two different correspondence methods may lead to significant performance differences. Furthermore, the wrist-elbow-in-line method is validated as more stable in practical application and extended for obstacle avoidance. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Thus, the proposed method is a model-based "joint space" method and exploits the coordination of the arms in the motion planning procedure. The motion planning is divided into translation planning and orientation stabilization. Only the final positions of the wrist centers need to be specified for translation planning; the object's orientation will adapt following the translation. Simulation is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. Comparison with the conventional method is performed to demonstrate the features of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cognitive neuroscience, traditionally focused on individual brains, is just beginning to investigate social cognition through realistic interpersonal interaction. However, quantitative investigation of the dynamical sensorimotor communication among interacting individuals in goal-directed ecological tasks is particularly challenging. Here, we recorded upper-body motion capture of 23 dyads, alternating their leader/follower role, in a tower-building task. Either a strategy of joining efforts or a strategy of independent action could in principle be used. We found that arm reach velocity profiles of participants tended to converge across trials. Automatic imitation of low-level motor control parameters demonstrates that the task is achieved through continuous action coordination as opposed to independent action planning. Moreover, the leader produced more consistent and predictable velocity profiles, suggesting an implicit strategy of signaling to the follower. This study serves as a validation of our joint goal-directed non-verbal task for future applications. In fact, the quantification of human-to-human continuous sensorimotor interaction, in a way that can be predicted and controlled, is probably one of the greatest challenges for the future of human–robot interaction. © 2015, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Background: Several studies investigating the use of electromyographic (EMG) signals in robot-based stroke neuro-rehabilitation to enhance functional recovery. Here we explored whether a classical EMG-based patterns recognition approach could be employed to predict patients' intentions while attempting to generate goal-directed movements in the horizontal plane. Methods. Nine right-handed healthy subjects and seven right-handed stroke survivors performed reaching movements in the horizontal plane. EMG signals were recorded and used to identify the intended motion direction of the subjects. To this aim, a standard pattern recognition algorithm (i.e., Support Vector Machine, SVM) was used. Different tests were carried out to understand the role of the inter- and intra-subjects' variability in affecting classifier accuracy. Abnormal muscular spatial patterns generating misclassification were evaluated by means of an assessment index calculated from the results achieved with the PCA, i.e., the so-called Coefficient of Expressiveness (CoE). Results: Processing the EMG signals of the healthy subjects, in most of the cases we were able to build a static functional map of the EMG activation patterns for point-to-point reaching movements on the horizontal plane. On the contrary, when processing the EMG signals of the pathological subjects a good classification was not possible. In particular, patients' aimed movement direction was not predictable with sufficient accuracy either when using the general map extracted from data of normal subjects and when tuning the classifier on the EMG signals recorded from each patient. Conclusions: The experimental findings herein reported show that the use of EMG patterns recognition approach might not be practical to decode movement intention in subjects with neurological injury such as stroke. Rather than estimate motion from EMGs, future scenarios should encourage the utilization of these signals to detect and interpret the normal and abnormal muscle patterns and provide feedback on their correct recruitment. © 2013 Cesqui et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

On the one hand, this new scenario raises problems of safety, which are being solved by adding suitable sensor batteries to robot control systems, and on the other hand, it entails dealing with psychophysical aspects as well. Motion intention understanding and prediction comes more natural and effective if the controlled movement is biologically inspired. In order to generate biologically inspired movements in a robotic-assisted surgery scenario, where a robotic assistant shares the execution of tasks with, or hands over tools to a surgeon, we designed a trajectory planning system based on an artificial neural network architecture trained on human actions. After the design and training of the neural controller for motion planning, we checked the objective characteristics of the achieved biologically inspired motion as functional minimization (minimum jerk), two-third power law and bell-shaped velocity. The controller was also experimentally implemented by using a redundant serial robotic arm (LWR4+, Kuka, Germany), and it was actually perceived as "human-like" in the majority of cases by naive subjects. The implemented neural-based control strategy provided to be an effective scheme for human-robot interaction control, also by qualitative assessment. © 2016 De Momi, Kranendonk, Valenti, Enayati and Ferrigno.},

	abstract = {A new complex model of human motor control has been developed, combining brain internal models and neural network mechanisms. Based on nervous system structures and operating principles, a feedforward block, a feedback controller and a cerebellum-like learning module have been integrated and tested with an anthropometric robotic arm. A simulated sequence of 8-like tracking tasks showed the contributions of these main loops over time. Different external dynamics were introduced. The role of feedback corrections, intrinsically imprecise due to sensorimotor delays, decreases, while the output of cerebellum, which has been learning, increases; the movement becomes more accurate. Moreover, an experimental session on a subject performing the task repetitions using a haptic device was carried out, recording upper limb kinematics. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Human bodies use the electrical currents to make the muscles move. Disconnection of the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles as a result of spinal cord injuries, causes paralysis below the level of injury. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is used to stimulate the peripheral nerves of the disabled limbs. The level of these electrical signals should be selected so that the desired tasks are done successfully. Applying the appropriate controller which can result a human like behaviour and the accomplishment of the desired tasks has become a significant research area. In this paper, the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) musculoskeletal model of human arm with six muscles is investigated and a new Adaptive optimal critic-based neuro-fuzzy controller is proposed to control the end point of the human arm model. Computer simulations are accomplished to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed neuro-fuzzy control structure. Adaptivity and muscle force optimization are of important features of the proposed neuro-fuzzy controller. The results show satisfactory behaviour. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Controlling human-like robots with musculoskeletal structure has been a challenging problem in engineering. In biological studies, motor synergy hypothesis has been proposed as a solution in order to control high degree-of-freedom and complex human body. In this paper, we focus on exploring the applicability of motor synergies in generating goal-directed movements by optimal control in a human-like robotic arm. We focus on three problems: 1) Can motor synergies facilitate the solving of optimal control problem? 2) What properties should motor synergies have in order to achieve tasks? 3) How should motor synergies be utilized better? For the first problem we show that goal-directed movements can be achieved by utilizing motor synergies which have properties of achieving the goals. For the second problem, we testify motor synergies which have different properties and discover that energy efficiency is an important aspect in motor synergies which can also be utilized to achieve goal-directed movements. This discovery also implies that we can obtain motor synergies by other ways rather than from goal-directed optimal control signals. For the third problem, we show that the control complexity can be further reduced by utilizing a subset of motor synergies which are effective to achieve goals. © 2013 Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Maintaining stability is a significant challenge during the control of a robot astronaut while climbing with human-like dual-arm action in a space station. This challenge is caused by conflicting force generated by dynamic internal forces in the closed chain during dual-arm climbing. In general, an impedance controller is suitable for solving this problem. However, the conflicting force in the rigid closed chain is stored in the virtual spring of the impedance controller (especially in microgravity), where even small disturbances cause a significant change in robot astronaut movements. As such, it is difficult to select suitable control parameters for the stable climbing of a robot astronaut. This paper proposes an adaptive algorithm to optimize the impedance controller parameters. This eliminates conflicting force disturbances, with one arm in compliance with the motion of the other. It provides scope for achieving stable motion without the need for precise control parameters. Finally, the stability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by Lyapunov theory using a robot called ASTROBOT. The experimental results show the validity of the proposed algorithm. © 2016 Author(s).},

	abstract = {As robots begin to permeate the everyday human workspace to collaborate in innumerable and varied tasks, the robotic structure must adhere and replicate human-like gestures for effective interaction. Whether rehabilitation or augmentation, upper arm human-robot interaction is some of the most prevalent and investigated forms of collaboration. However, currently robotic control schemes fail to capture the true intricacies of anthropomorphic motion and intent during simple bi-manual manipulation tasks. This paper focuses on the introduction of bio-inspired control schemes for robot manipulators that coordinate with humans during dual arm object manipulation. Using experimental data captured from human subjects performing a variety of every-day bi-manual life tasks, we propose a bio-inspired controller for a robot arm, that is able to learn human inter- and intra-arm coordination during those tasks. Using dimensionality reduction techniques to make comprehensible the linear correlations of both arms in joint space we fit and utilize potential fields that attract the robot to human-like configurations. This method is then tested using real experimental data across multiple bi-manual tasks with a comparison made between the bio-inspired and traditional inverse kinematic controllers. Using a robotic kinematic chain identical to the human arm, models are evaluated for anthropomorphic configurations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

From the measured data, we got an average stiffness distribution. In simulation, by controlling robot arm to lift human body up from the estimated softest place and minimizing the load of human body, we obtained a most comfortable robot motion.

Thus the development of a neural architecture providing unified mechanisms for actual, mental, observed and imitated actions could enhance robot performance, enhance human-robot social interactions, and inform specific human brain processes. Here we present a model, including a fronto-parietal network that implements sensorimotor transformations (inverse kinematics, workspace visuo-spatial rotations), for self-intended and imitation performance. Our findings revealed that this neural model can perform accurate and robust 3D actual/mental arm reaching while reproducing human-like kinematics. Also, using visuo-spatial remapping, the neural model can imitate arm reaching independently of a demonstrator-imitator viewpoint. This work is a first step towards providing the basis of a future neural architecture for combining cognitive and sensorimotor processing levels that will allow for multi-level mental simulation when executing actual, mental, observed, and imitated actions for dexterous arm movements. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A long standing goal in rehabilitation robotics is to emulate the human-like stable grasping operations by upper limb prosthesis. For stable grasping and manipulation by a prosthetic hand, the finger joints should follow the trajectories of the natural counterparts. Although a number of commercial prosthetic hands and research prototypes have been developed, mimicking the human-like movement is still a challenge. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of fast on-line error minimizing control approach during trajectory tracking. In this paper, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) architecture that can generate desired motions through online error minimization. Focus is on emulating the human-like finger joint trajectories by Tezpur University (TU) Biomimetic Hand. The MPC perform the online error minimization and control in a unified way by tracking reference trajectories. The reference trajectories were generated by recording the finger joint trajectories of human hand. The proposed MPC was implemented on the TU Biomimetic Hand index finger; wherein finger joint trajectories of human finger was used to actuate the control architecture. The simulation results show that the finger joint trajectories of TU Biomimetic Hand are in close conformity to that of the human finger. The experimental results for the TU Biomimetic Hand index finger satisfies the dynamic constraints of human hand and thus ensures stable grasping by the prosthetic hand. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the biomechatronic design and development of an anthropomorphic robotic head able to perform human eye movements as a tool for experimental investigation in neuroscience. This robotic head has been designed upon specifications derived from models of the human head and of human neck and eye movements, in terms of total mass, geometry, number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f.), joint velocities and accelerations. The robotic head has 7 d.o.f.: 4 d.o.f. specifically allowing the neck movements and 3 d.o.f. dedicated to the faster eye movements; it has a total mass of approximately 5.6 kg, and it is capable of reaching a maximum eye velocity and acceleration of 1000°/s and 10 000°/s2, respectively, compatible with human data. The coordination of neck and eye movements allows smooth pursuit; and the independent eye yaw movements allow vergence. As an example, the use of this robotic head for validating a novel neurophysiological model of gaze control is presented. The model has been implemented on the robot, which can transform the retina images into their mapping onto the relevant brain area (superior colliculus), calculate the coordinates of a visual stimulus appearing in the periphery, generate the velocity profiles for the eye motors and execute the eye movements. This implementation shows that the robotic head can perform human-like saccades and allows experimental comparison with human data, so as to validate and revise the model itself. © 2008 VSP.},

	abstract = {Recently, biologically inspired control approaches for robotic systems that involve the use of central pattern generators (CPGs) have been attracting considerable attention owing to the fact that most humans or animals move and walk easily without explicitly controlling their movements. Furthermore, they exhibit natural adaptive motions against unexpected disturbances or environmental changes without considering their kinematic configurations. Inspired by such novel phenomena, this paper endeavors to achieve self-adapting robotic arm motion. For this, biologically inspired CPG based control is proposed. In particular, this approach deals with crucial problems such as motion generation and repeatability of the joints emerged remarkably in most of redundant DOF systems. These problems can be overcome by employing a control based on artificial neural oscillators, virtual force and virtual muscle damping instead of trajectories planning and inverse kinematics. Biologically inspired motions can be attained if the joints of a robotic arm are coupled to neural oscillators and virtual muscles. We experimentally demonstrate self-adaptation motions that that enables a 7-DOF robotic arm to make adaptive changes from the given motion to a compliant motion. In addition, it is verified with real a real robotic arm that human-like movements and motion repeatability are satisfied under kinematic redundancy of joints. ©2010 IEEE.},

In this paper it will be argued for a developmental robotics approach for learning to speak. On the basis of current literature a blueprint of a brain model will be outlined for this kind of robots and preliminary scenarios for knowledge acquisition will be described. Furthermore it will be illustrated that natural speech acquisition mainly results from learning during face-To-face communication and it will be argued that learning to speak should be based on human-robot face-To-face communication. Here the human acts like a caretaker or teacher and the robot acts like a speech-Acquiring toddler. This is a fruitful basic scenario not only for learning to speak, but also for learning to communicate in general, including to produce co-verbal manual gestures and to produce co-verbal facial expressions.  © Bernd J.

The hand has an independent palm and five identical modular fingers, each finger has three DOFs and four joints. All the actuators and electronics are integrated in the finger body and the palm. By using powerful super flat brushless DC motors, tiny harmonic drivers and BGA form DSPs and FPGAs, the whole finger's size is about one third smaller than the former finger in the DLR/HIT Hand I. By using the steel coupling mechanism, the phalanx distal's transmission ratio is exact 1:1 in the whole movement range. At the same time, the multisensory dexterous hand integrates position, force/torque and temperature sensors. The hierarchical hardware structure of the hand consists of the finger DSPs, the finger FPGAs, the palm FPGA and the PCI based DSP/FPGA board. The hand can communicate with external with PPSeCo , CAN and Internet. Instead of extra cover, the packing mechanism of the hand is implemented directly in the finger body and palm to make the hand smaller and more human like. The whole weight of the hand is about 1.5Kg and the fingertip force can reach 10N. ©2008 IEEE.},

We show that for neural networks with binary thresholded units, channel capacity is maximised with a recruitment strategy that produces PN. The size principle also emerges, in agreement with observation. We therefore argue that Fitt's law, speed-accuracy trade-off, and the minimum variance trajectories (including minimum jerk trajectories for limiting brief movements), which are observed in most human point-to-point movements, have evolved as optimal strategies resulting from maximising channel capacity. We conclude that biomimicry of minimum variance and minimum jerk trajectories in robotics is probably only of aesthetic value when using standard technology. In contrast, biomimicry using neuromorphic technology in which networks are built from stochastic silicon 'neurons' with thresholds, is functional biomimetics and optimization of channel capacity will produce behaviours that are human-like.},

The proposed non-human-like modalities are a screen displaying retrieved knowledge of the robot to the human and a pointer mounted above the robot head for pointing directions and referring to objects in shared visual space as an equivalent for arm and hand gestures. Initially, pre-interaction feedback is explored in an experiment investigating different approach behaviors in order to find socially acceptable trajectories to increase the success of interactions and thus efficiency of information retrieval. Secondly, pre-evaluated humanlike modalities are introduced.

The aspect of self-motion is also analyzed using the null-space motion of the manipulator Jacobian.

	abstract = {Anthropomorphic "humanoid" robots are suggested to be more competent in social communicative interactions than industrial robots, because humans interact more intuitively with them. It is, therefore, critical to evaluate the acceptance of an agent as possible partner for joint interaction. One possible method is to utilize the phenomenon of motor interference (MI). It claims, that observation of an incongruent movement of another individual leads to a higher variance in one's own movement trajectory. Although this effect has been demonstrated while observing a human agent, the researchers were unable to show increased variance in the subjects' movements if they observed an arm of an industrial robot moving with piecewise-constant velocity. In contrast, in other recent studies, MI was demonstrated when subjects watched a humanoid robot performing biological movements based on prerecording of a human experimenter, even if it was not the case when the same robot moved with constant (artificial) velocity. The purpose of the present study was two-fold: 1) we aimed to replicate these results using video-presentations of the agents, and 2) we asked whether quasi-biological movement trajectories are sufficient to elicit MI. We presented subjects, who were instructed to perform horizontal and vertical arm movements, with videos of a human agent or of a humanoid robot, who performed congruent or incongruent arm movements. Robotic movements were produced with a quasi-biological minimum-jerk velocity profile. We found MI both for the human agent and the robot, suggesting that an artificial human-like movement velocity profile (minimum-jerk) is sufficient to facilitate perception of humanoid robots as interaction partners, and that the measurement of MI using a face-to-face video setup can serve as a tool for objectively evaluating humanoid robots.},

The developed method is based on neuroscientific assumptions and experimental evidence coming from the observation of the human behavior during power grip. It is based on the minimization of a suitably defined function to identify the optimal grasp configuration and the choice of a logarithmic spiral trajectory for moving the fingers. The behavior of ten different subjects during the grasping action has been analyzed with the CyberGlove motion capture data glove. A common thumb posture has been observed and has been introduced in the grasping algorithm. The algorithm performance has been tested on an anthropomorphic robotic hand by means of simulation trials.

	abstract = {Sensing and manipulation of small objects are among the most challenging, requiring a very high degree of coordinated actuation in producing assembly work robots. It is inevitable for the development of a robot that is designed to execute complex tasks to apply multiple sensors for determination of a target's attributes. In this study, a seven-link dual-arm robot with three-fingered hands that exhibits human-like skills to manipulate small parts like nuts and bolts is proposed. The dynamical system of the robot requires attention in many aspects including control, sensor integration, image processing and trajectory planning strategies for small object manipulation. In this paper, the implementation of sensor integration between force and vision sensors for real-time autonomous grasping and screwing of an M10 nut and bolt by the robot is discussed. The measured data on the object or environment is used to create the robot's trajectory in real-time operation and to ensure safety of the robot. The proposed method applies a visual servoing structure for the recognition by camera, and impedance control for the hand robot to produce softness to the fingers. The required kinematics adjustments to modify the trajectories of arms and the robot hand's configuration are applied according to the measured data by the sensors. Experimental results indicate the performance of the proposed method in achieving the sensor-based planning and control for fully autonomous screwing task in real-time experiments. This shows the capability of the dual-manipulator hand robot for manipulating small objects and its applicability for more complex assembly tasks in the future. © 2012 The Authors.},

It consists of a strategic controller for online computing (sub-)optimal control strategies under consideration of dynamic models, safety specifications, and learned knowledge. The second building block is an operational controller for providing certified safety when dealing with behaviors that are not completely predictable, for instance in case of faults. This paper extends the architecture by a specific technique for the strategic controller: For the case of an intelligent manufacturing system which reacts adaptively to a human operator, control trajectories for a robot arm are computed online such that collision with the operator is excluded. The computation is based on solving a mixed-integer programming problem that takes a dynamic safety area around the operator into account as constraint. © 2009 IFAC.},

For human data acquisition, subjects were asked to reach and grasp two objects (a clawhammer and a pen) positioned in four different orientations. The subjects were primed by specification of the task to be performed with the objects after the grasp. For the hammer, the task could be one of hammering or prying a nail, or transporting the hammer; for the pen the task could be transporting or using the pen for drawing a circle. The human movements were recorded using a motion capture system and analyzed off-line. The results indicate that humans deploy different grasps for objects depending on the task specification, even though the orientation and location of the objects are kept the same.

	abstract = {In recent, control approaches for the human-like behavior in the field of service robotics have been attracting considerable attention, since most humans or animals perform various tasks uncomplicatedly. Hence simple control methods based on gaining a physical insight into human reaching movement in redundancy of DOFs have been proposed. In comparison with the conventional approaches, the proposed method tries to control directly robotic systems in task-space with the control signal composed of linear superposition of three terms 1) joint-damping, 2) virtual spring, and 3) virtual damper in task-space. In particular, our work contains a muscle tension effect of a human under the gravity. This give birth to energy efficient natural motions avoiding problems on repeatability of the motion and ill-posedness problems emerged in most of redundant DOF systems. Thus, this paper exhibits expendability of the position control into the orientation control and compliant behavior. It is verified with a real robotic arm that satisfies human-like movements and motion repeatability under kinematic redundancy of joints. © 2011 IEEE.},

To make the robot's movements human-like, we generate approximately straight-line trajectories by using two heading direction angles of the tool-point quite analogously to how movement is represented in the primate central nervous system. Two additional angles control the tool's spatial orientation so that it follows the tool-point's collision-free path. A fifth equation governs the redundancy angle, which controls the elevation of the elbow so as to avoid obstacles and respect joint limits. These variables make it possible to generate movement while sitting in an attractor (or, in the langauge of the potential field approach, in a minimum). We demonstrate the approach on an assistant robot [1], which interacts with human users in a shared workspace. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a mobile humanoid robot platform able to execute various services for humans in their everyday environments. For service in more intelligent and varied environments, the control system of a robot must operate efficiently to ensure a coordinated robot system. We enhanced the efficiency of the control system by developing a dual-network control system. The network system consists of two communication protocols: high-speed IEEE 1394, and a highly stable Controller Area Network (CAN). A service framework is also introduced for the coordinated task execution by a humanoid robot. To execute given tasks, various sub-systems of the robot were coordinated effectively by this system. Performance assessments of the presented framework and the proposed control system are experimentally conducted. MAHRU-M, as a platform for a mobile humanoid robot, recognizes the designated object. The object's pose is calculated by performing model-based object tracking using a particle filter with back projection-based sampling. A unique approach is used to solve the human-like arm inverse kinematics, allowing the control system to generate smooth trajectories for each joint of the humanoid robot. A mean-shift algorithm using bilateral filtering is also used for real-time and robust object tracking. The results of the experiment show that a robot can execute its services efficiently in human workspaces such as an office or a home. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent findings in neuroscience suggest an overlap between brain regions involved in the execution of movement and perception of another's movement. This so-called "action-perception coupling" is supposed to serve our ability to automatically infer the goals and intentions of others by internal simulation of their actions. A consequence of this coupling is motor interference (MI), the effect of movement observation on the trajectory of one's own movement. Previous studies emphasized that various features of the observed agent determine the degree of MI, but could not clarify how human-like an agent has to be for its movements to elicit MI and, more importantly, what 'human-like' means in the context of MI. Thus, we investigated in several experiments how different aspects of appearance and motility of the observed agent influence motor interference (MI). Participants performed arm movements in horizontal and vertical directions while observing videos of a human, a humanoid robot, or an industrial robot arm with either artificial (industrial) or human-like joint configurations. Our results show that, given a human-like joint configuration, MI was elicited by observing arm movements of both humanoid and industrial robots. However, if the joint configuration of the robot did not resemble that of the human arm, MI could longer be demonstrated. Our findings present evidence for the importance of human-like joint configuration rather than other human-like features for perception-action coupling when observing inanimate agents. © 2012 Kupferberg et al.},

Among human-like behaviors, arm motions of the humanoid robot are essential for the communication with people through motions. In this work, a mathematical representation for characterizing human arm motions is first proposed. The human arm motions are characterized by the elbow elevation angle that is determined using the position and orientation of human hands. That representation is mathematically obtained using an approximation tool, Response Surface Method (RSM). Then a method to generate human-like arm motions in real time using the proposed representation is presented. The proposed method was evaluated to generate human-like arm motions when the humanoid robot was asked to move its arms from a point to another point including the rotation of hand. An example motion was performed using the KIST humanoid robot, MAHRU. © 2006 IEEE.},

The proposed surgical manipulator affords 7-d.o.f. joints using a cable-pulley mechanism. The surgical manipulator has upper and lower arms akin to a human arm, and has an elbow joint as an additional d.o.f. joint. In addition, a remote controller was developed to measure the human arm position and deliver the angle data of the 7-d.o.f. joints to the surgical manipulator by TCP/IP communication. The calculated joint angles from the remote controller have a linear relationship with the measured angles from a human arm. The tracking experiment was performed and an approach angle to the surgical site was measured using a liver model. The proposed manipulator has a wider angle range compared to that of a conventional surgical tool.

Furthermore, based on the new algorithm we utilize the redundancy of the robot to avoid joint velocity limits.

A script is used as a tool for describing tasks to easily regulate actions of the sub-systems while the robot is performing the task. The performance of the presented framework is experimentally demonstrated as follows: A mobile robot, as the platform of the task execution, recognizes the designated object. The object pose is calculated by performing model-based object tracking using a particle filter with back projection-based sampling. An approach proposed by Kim et al. [1] is used to solve a human-like arm inverse kinematics and then the control system generates smooth trajectories for each joint of the humanoid robot. The mean-shift algorithm using bilateral filtering is also used for real-time and robust object tracking. The results of our implementation show the robot can execute the task efficiently in human workspaces, such as an office or home. © 2009 SICE.},

	abstract = {The automatic tendency to anthropomorphize our interaction partners and make use of experience acquired in earlier interaction scenarios leads to the suggestion that social interaction with humanoid robots is more pleasant and intuitive than that with industrial robots. An objective method applied to evaluate the quality of human-robot interaction is based on the phenomenon of motor interference (MI). It claims that a face-to-face observation of a different (incongruent) movement of another individual leads to a higher variance in one's own movement trajectory. In social interaction, MI is a consequence of the tendency to imitate the movement of other individuals and goes along with mutual rapport, sense of togetherness, and sympathy. Although MI occurs while observing a human agent, it disappears in case of an industrial robot moving with piecewise constant velocity. Using a robot with human-like appearance, a recent study revealed that its movements led to MI, only if they were based on human prerecording (biological velocity), but not on constant (artificial) velocity profile. However, it remained unclear, which aspects of the human prerecorded movement triggered MI: biological velocity profile or variability in movement trajectory. To investigate this issue, we applied a quasi-biological minimum-jerk velocity profile (excluding variability in the movement trajectory as an influencing factor of MI) to motion of a humanoid robot, which was observed by subjects performing congruent or incongruent arm movements. The increase in variability in subjects' movements occurred both for the observation of a human agent and for the robot performing incongruent movements, suggesting that an artificial human-like movement velocity profile is sufficient to facilitate the perception of humanoid robots as interaction partners. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

	abstract = {Problem statement: Present researches focus to make humanoid robots more and more autonomous so they can assist human in daily works like taking care of children, aged or disabled persons. In such social activities, the contemporary humanoid robots are expected to have human like morphology and gait. Studies on bipedal locomotion for humanoid robots are then part of the hottest topics in the field of robotic researches. Knowing the benefits of arm swinging for human gait, we propose in this study a new prototype of female humanoid robot morphology having the capabilities to swing arms during step walking. Approach: A new humanoid robot prototype had been introduced based on a human morphology corresponding to a woman whose weight is 70 kg and height is 1,73 m and using realistic gait parameters of a women. The female humanoid robot prototype was composed of fifteen links associated to twenty-six degrees of freedom. Winter statistical model had been applied to determine all physical parameters corresponding to each link. Modeling the proposed humanoid robot implies first to establish the kinematic model basically founded on Euler's transformation matrix and then to set the dynamic model computed using the Newton-Euler method. To show how the arms played an important role in bipedal gait, we had chosen to consider the whole body as two independent robotic systems: the upper body and the lower body. Results: Both three dimensional kinematic and dynamic models of the humanoid robot had been developed. The three dimensional humanoid robot was controlled via a feedback linearization control during the single support, impact and double support phases. The simulation results showed the arm swing during the step of walking. Conclusion: The humanoid robot proposed has a human like morphology and ensures the function of a step walking with arm swinging. The applied control laws have ensured to the robot desired performances during a step walking. © 2010 Science Publications.},

	abstract = {The actuator is an essential part of robotic bipedal walking. The general approach is to transfer joints for bipedal legs from robot arms and therefore they are not well adapted to walking. This paper presents a model for an biologically motivated actuator. The actuator is designed for a human-like biped to perform highly dynamic motions like running and jumping. There are two commonly used concepts in the field of robotics. The first favors a stiff actuator with high gear-ratio and position controller. The second utilize a compliant actuator that usually features low power consumption and is torque controlled. The actuator presented in this paper combines the benefits of both concepts. A theoretical model is derived to improve the dynamic behavior and examine the energy consumption of the actuator and amplifier. Several test with a prototype leg and in a simulation environment are presented. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.},

	abstract = {Our overall research interest is in synthesizing human like reaching and grasping using anthropomorphic robot hand-arm systems, as well as understanding the principles underlying human control of these actions. When one needs to define the control and task requirements in the Cartesian space, the problem of inverse kinematics needs to be solved. For non-redundant manipulators, a desired end-effector position and orientation can be achieved by a finite number of solutions. For redundant manipulators however, there are in general infinitely many solutions where the cardinality of the solution set must be made finite by imposing certain constraints. In this paper, we consider the Mitsubishi PA10 manipulator which is similar to the human arm, in the sense that both wrist and shoulder joints can be considered to emulate a 3DOF ball joint. We explicitly derive the analytic solution for the inverse kinematics using quaternions. Then, we derive a parameterization in terms of a pure quaternion called the swivel quaternion. The swivel quaternion is similar to the elbow swivel angle used in most approaches, but avoid the computation of inverse trigonometric functions. This parameterization of the self-motion manifold is continuous with any end-effector motion. Given the pose of the end-effector and the swivel quaternion (or swivel angle), the algorithm derives all solution of the inverse kinematics (finite number). We then show how the parameterization of the elbow self-motion can be used for the real-time control of the PA10 manipulator in the presence of obstacles. © 2010 by ASME.},

	abstract = {Performing manipulation tasks interactively in real environments requires a high degree of accuracy and stability. At the same time, when one cannot assume a fully deterministic and static environment, one must endow the robot with the ability to react rapidly to sudden changes in the environment. These considerations make the task of reach and grasp difficult to deal with. We follow a Programming by Demonstration (PbD) approach to the problem and take inspiration from the way humans adapt their reach and grasp motions when perturbed. This is in sharp contrast to previous work in PbD that uses unperturbed motions for training the system and then applies perturbation solely during the testing phase. In this work, we record the kinematics of arm and fingers of human subjects during unperturbed and perturbed reach and grasp motions. In the perturbed demonstrations, the target's location is changed suddenly after the onset of the motion. Data show a strong coupling between the hand transport and finger motions. We hypothesize that this coupling enables the subject to seamlessly and rapidly adapt the finger motion in coordination with the hand posture. To endow our robot with this competence, we develop a coupled dynamical system based controller, whereby two dynamical systems driving the hand and finger motions are coupled. This offers a compact encoding for reach-to-grasp motions that ensures fast adaptation with zero latency for re-planning. We show in simulation and on the real iCub robot that this coupling ensures smooth and "human-like" motions. We demonstrate the performance of our model under spatial, temporal and grasp type perturbations which show that reaching the target with coordinated handarm motion is necessary for the success of the task. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {How should robotic or prosthetic arms be programmed to move? Copying human smooth movements is popular in synthetic systems, but what does this really achieve? We cannot address these biomimetic issues without a deep understanding of why natural movements are so stereotyped. In this article, we distinguish between 'functional' and 'aesthetic' biomimetics. Functional biomimetics requires insight into the problem that nature has solved and recognition that a similar problem exists in the synthetic system. In aesthetic biomimetics, nature is copied for its own sake and no insight is needed. We examine the popular minimum jerk (MJ) model that has often been used to generate smooth human-like point-to-point movements in synthetic arms. The MJ model was originally justified as maximizing 'smoothness'; however, it is also the limiting optimal trajectory for a wide range of cost functions for brief movements, including the minimum variance (MV) model, where smoothness is a by-product of optimizing the speed-accuracy trade-off imposed by proportional noise (PN: signal-dependent noise with the standard deviation proportional to mean). PN is unlikely to be dominant in synthetic systems, and the control objectives of natural movements (speed and accuracy) would not be optimized in synthetic systems by human-like movements. Thus, employing MJ or MV controllers in robotic arms is just aesthetic biomimetics. For prosthetic arms, the goal is aesthetic by definition, but it is still crucial to recognize that MV trajectories and PN are deeply embedded in the human motor system. Thus, PN arises at the neural level, as a recruitment strategy of motor units and probably optimizes motor neuron noise. Human reaching is under continuous adaptive control. For prosthetic devices that do not have this natural architecture, natural plasticity would drive the system towards unnatural movements. We propose that a truly neuromorphic system with parallel force generators (muscle fibres) and noisy drivers (motor neurons) would permit plasticity to adapt the control of a prosthetic limb towards human-like movement. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

With these newly developed capabilities Santos™ can be used to test the joystick design, study grasping, facilitate vehicle interior design, test visibility for product design, predict correct dynamic motion or posture subject to external loads, and investigate muscle forces, and muscle stress.

Instead of these sensors, the collision detection and the safety motion are achieved by a simple method based on the current characteristics in according to operating of each joint motor of robot manipulator.

The hand has an independent palm and five identical modular fingers, each finger has three DOFs and four joints. All the actuators and electronics are integrated in the finger body and the palm. By using powerful super flat brushless DC motors, tiny harmonic drives and BGA form DSPs and FPGAs, the whole finger's size is about one third smaller than the former finger in the DLR/HIT Hand I. By using the steel coupling mechanism, the phalanx distal's transmission ratio is exact 1:1 in the whole movement range. At the same time, the multisensory dexterous hand integrates position, force/torque and temperature sensors. The hierarchical hardware structure of the hand consists of the finger DSPs, the finger FPGAs, the palm FPGA and the PCI based DSP/FPGA board. The hand can communicate with external with PPSeCo, CAN and Internet. Instead of extra cover, the packing mechanism of the hand is implemented directly in the finger body and palm to make the hand smaller and more human like. The whole weight of the hand is about 1.5Kg and the fingertip force can reach ION. © 2008 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A new approach for solving an optimal control problem of ball pitching with an underactuated human-like robot arm is proposed. The system dynamics is simplified to a planar two-link robot with actuation only at the shoulder joint and a passive spring at the elbow joint representing the stiffness of the arm. The objective is to accelerate the ball from an initial configuration at rest in such a way that the projection of its velocity along a certain elevation angle is maximal at a predefined release line. The suggested procedure makes use of a parameterization of the robot motion in terms of geometric relations among the generalized coordinates. We systematically formulate a necessary condition for an optimal motion resulting in a nonlinear differential equation that describes a synchronization of the joint angles. A suitable solution is found by numerically searching over a finite number of free initial conditions. ©2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A simple control method for redundant multi-joint arm was proposed recently by gaining a physical insight into human multi-joint reaching movements in redundancy of DOFs. Differently from the traditional approaches, the method need neither introduce any artificial performance index to resolve kinematics ill-posedness nor calculate the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian matrix of task coordinates with respect to joint coordinates. This novel approach is based upon an idea of "Virtual spring-damper hypothesis," and the control signal is composed of linear superposition of three terms 1) joint-damping, and 2) virtual damper effects in parallel to 3) virtual spring effects in task space. This paper shows through experiments by using an industrial robot arm (PA-10) with redundant multi-joints that the control signal can generate smooth reaching motions without incurring any annoying self-motion even in the case of industrial robots. It is shown further that virtual damping effects in task space play an important rule in making endpoint trajectories of the robot arm quasi-straight. Consequently, the control signal can easily generate human-like multi-joint movements of robot arms without spending a huge amount of computational cost for motion plannings of not only the endpoint trajectory but also each joint trajectory. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Dual-arm manipulation is an increasingly important skill for robots operating in home, retail and industrial environments. Dual-arm manipulation is especially essential for tasks involving large objects which are harder to grasp and manipulate using a single arm. In this work, we address dual-arm manipulation of objects in indoor environments. We are particularly focused on tasks that involve an upright orientation constraint on the grasped object. Such constraints are often present in human environments, e.g. when manipulating a tray of food or a container with fluids. In this paper, we present a search-based approach that is capable of planning dual-arm motions, often within one second, in cluttered environments while adhering to the orientation constraints. Our approach systematically constructs a graph in task space and generates motions that are consistent across runs with similar start/goal configurations and are low-cost. These motions come with guarantees on completeness and bounds on the suboptimality with respect to the graph that encodes the planning problem. For many problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human interacting with the robot. © 2012 IEEE.},

Based on a previous work, this paper advances a numerical framework that optimizes the throwing motions and generates the associated dynamic features for a whole-body humanoid mechanism. To generate physically feasible throwing motions in a fully predictive manner, rigorous dynamic models, such as actuation, biped balance based on Zero-Moment Point (ZMP), and ground reaction loads, are associated with the constraints. The algorithm outputs include the motion, required actuator torques, release parameters, and object projectile. Realistic human-like motions of sidearm and maximum distance throwing are generated as optimized solutions, which demonstrate valid kinematic and dynamic cause-effect relations. The sidearm throw shows better optimality than the overarm throw in terms of actuator torques under the proposed mechanical model; it is characterized by the unique hand trajectory and effective utilization of torso axial rotation. The maximum distance throw is associated with active movement of the arm and torso with larger ranges of motion; it is the release height and speed that increase accordingly. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Optical torque sensors integrated into each joint enable measurement of contacting forces along the entire manipulator surface. A variable admittance control strategy was elaborated to increase the robot functionality and to achieve the human-like dynamics of interaction. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only provides safe interaction of the robot arm with a person, but also improves the effectiveness of contact task performance. The paper also presents a novel concept of avoidance of an obstacle of unknown shape. The tactile sensory ability of the developed manipulator allows robot links to follow the object contour and to perform motion planning in the dynamic environment. The information on the applied normal force vector, object shape and target point coordinates is supplied to the motion planning system. The algorithms for contact point detection, object geometry recognition, and estimation of contacting object stiffness are detailed. The numerical simulation elicits a capability of the proposed method to approximate various object shapes precisely. The experimental results showed that the local admittance control and motion planner allowed the end-effector to follow the object contour in a very smooth, consistent manner while reaching the target point. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In addition, humans or animals exhibit natural adaptive motions without considering their kinematic configurations against unexpected disturbances or environment changes. In this paper, we focus on rhythmic arm motions that can be achieved by using a controller based on neural oscillators and virtual force. In comparison with conventional researches, this work treats neither trajectories planning nor inverse kinematics. Instead of those, a few desired points in task-space and a control method with Jacobian transpose and joint velocity damping are merely adopted. In addition, if the joints of robotic arms are coupled to neural oscillators, they may be capable of achieving biologically inspired motions corresponding to environmental changes. To verify the proposed control scheme, we perform some simulations to trace a desired motion and show the potential features related with self-adaptation that enables a three-link planar arm to make adaptive changes from the given motion to a compliant motion. Specifically, we investigate that human-like movements and motion repeatability are satisfied under kinematic redundancy of joints. © 2009 IEEE.},

This will be a trade-off at all times. The best biological solution of a detail is often simple in the function but too complex for the technical analogue. The technical materials are often missing what make a one-To-one copy impossible. The combination of biology and robots leads to smoother and compliant movement, which is more pleasant for us as people. Biologically inspired robots embody no rigid movement, which are made possible by special joints, or actuators, which give way, and can both actively and passively, adapt stiffness in different situations.

The first section gives a short introduction as to how Bionik engineers think in terms of compliant machines and whose technical realisation. The second section looks briefly at mechanical aspects, limitations and constraints and furthermore describes the human-like anthropomorphic five-finger hand. This section also comprises a short view of the used fluidic muscle actuators of the company FESTO.

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose an assembly robot that exhibits specific human-like skills, with minimal structural cost and a number of external sensors. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have employed vision processing using multiple cameras to determine targets and postures and propose strategies to determine the pose of a target and to prevent collisions between the fingers and obstacles in an environment with mixed objects. Furthermore, a dynamic trajectory planner integrates the vision and force sensors of the robot hand for the assigned task. Findings - The authors obtained satisfactory experimental results for autonomous real-time grasping and screwing. The results verified the capability of the robot for handling small objects. Research limitations/implications - More effective robotic manipulation requires a higher degree of target orientation data, which will be a future study of this research. Practical implications - Practicality has been established through results, indicating the capability of the robot to implement human-like skilled manipulation of small objects. This can potentially reduce the high labor cost associated with the small-scale manufacture of custom-made products. Originality/value - Screwing of nuts of minimum M2 size (diameter, 4.6?mm) and M8-M10 bolts (head diameter, 15-19.6?mm; length, 50-80?mm) by cooperating two seven-link arm manipulators and three-fingered hands shows the robot's capability to manipulate small objects.

	abstract = {In this paper, we have developed a novel control law to exhibit human-motion characteristics in redundant robot arm-trunk systems for reaching tasks. This newly developed method nullifies the need for the computation of pseudo-inverse of Jacobian while the formulation and optimization of any artificial performance index is not necessary. The time-varying properties of the muscle stiffness and damping as well as the low-pass filter characteristics of human muscles have been modeled by the proposed control law. The newly developed control law uses a time-varying damping shaping matrix and a bijective joint muscle mapping function to describe the human-motion characteristics for reaching motion like quasi-straight line trajectory of the end-effector and symmetric bell shaped velocity profile. The aspect of self-motion and repeatability, which are inherent in human-motion, are also analyzed and successfully modeled using the proposed method. Simulation results show the efficacy of the newly developed algorithm in describing the human-motion characteristics. ©2010 IEEE.},

WABIAN-2R has two 1-DOF passive joints in its feet to enable it to bend its toes in steady walking. Further, it has two 6-DOF legs, a 2-DOF pelvis, a 2-DOF trunk, two 7-DOF arms with 3-DOF hands, and a 3-DOF neck. In addition, a new algorithm for generating walking patterns with stretched knees and heel-contact and toe-off motions based on the ZMP criterion is described. In this pattern generation, some parameters of the foot trajectories of a biped robot are optimized by using a genetic algorithm in order to generate a continuous and smooth leg motion. Software simulations and walking experiments are conducted, and the effectiveness of the pattern generation and mechanism of WABIAN-2R, which have the ability to realize more human-like walking styles in a humanoid robot, are confirmed. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a robotics-based model for choice reaching experiments on visual atten-tion. In these experiments participants were asked to make rapid reach movements toward a target in an odd-color search task, i.e., reaching for a green square among red squares and vice versa (e.g., Song and Nakayama, 2008). Interestingly these studies found that in a high number of trials movements were initially directed toward a distractor and only later were adjusted toward the target. These "curved" trajectories occurred particularly frequently when the target in the directly preceding trial had a different color (priming effect). Our model is embedded in a closed-loop control of a LEGO robot arm aiming to mimic these reach movements. The model is based on our earlier work which suggests that target selection in visual search is implemented through parallel interactions between competitive and cooperative processes in the brain (Heinke and Humphreys, 2003; Heinke and Backhaus, 2011). To link this model with the control of the robot arm we implemented a topological representation of movement parameters following the dynamic field theory (Erlhagen and Schoener, 2002).The robot arm is able to mimic the results of the odd-color search task including the priming effect and also generates human-like trajectories with a bell-shaped velocity profile. Theoretical implications and predictions are discussed in the paper. © 2012 Strauss and Heinke.},

Movements of a redundant seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator, having a kinematic structure similar to that of the human arm, have been simulated. The design of the trajectory is based on theory about attentive vision in humans, and biomimetic considerations are used to infer laws to obtain human-like movements in inverse kinematics. The inverse kinematics is computed using a closed-loop algorithm with redundancy resolution where physically motivated secondary tasks are imposed to the internal motions, with the "Virtual End-Effectors" approach. Outputs of the IK algorithm related to drawing trajectories in the task space are compared with the positions of the joints of a human performing the same drawing task, computed from the images caught by a three-camera system.},

At the first stage, we have developed a human-like biped robot, WABIAN (WAseda BIped humANoid), which has a thirty-five mechanical degrees of freedom. Its height is 1.66 [m] and its weight 107.4 [kg]. In this paper, a moment compensation method is described for stability, which is based on the motion of its head, legs and arms. Also, a follow walking method is proposed which is based on a pattern switching technique. By a combination of both methods, the biped robot is able to perform dynamic stamping, walking forward and backward in a continuous time while someone is pushing or pulling its hand in such a way. Using WABIAN, human-fellow walking experiments are conducted, and the effectiveness of the methods are verified. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {Co-verbal gestures, the spontaneous gestures that accompany human speech, form an integral part of human communications; they have been shown to have a variety of beneficial effects on listener behaviour. Therefore, we suggest that a humanoid robot, which aims to communicate effectively with human users, should gesture in a human-like way, and thus engender similar beneficial effects on users. In order to investigate whether robot-performed co-verbal gestures do produce these effects, and are thus worthwhile for a communicative robot, we have conducted two user studies. In the first study we investigated whether users paid attention to our humanoid robot for longer when it performed co-verbal gestures, than when it performed small arm movements unrelated to the speech. Our findings confirmed our expectations, as there was a very significant difference in the length of time that users paid attention between the two conditions. In the second user study we investigated whether gestures performed during speech improved user memory of facts accompanied by gestures and whether they were linked in memory to the speech they accompanied. An observable affect on the speed and certainty of recall was found. We consider these observations of normative responses to the gestures performed, to be an indication of the value of co-verbal gesture for a communicative humanoid robot, and an objective measure of the success of our gesturing method. © 2011 IEEE.},
