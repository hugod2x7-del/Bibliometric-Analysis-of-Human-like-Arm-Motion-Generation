Abstract = {As robots are starting to become part of our daily lives, they must be
   able to cooperate in a natural and efficient manner with humans to be
   socially accepted. Human-like morphology and motion are often considered
   key features for intuitive human-robot interactions because they allow
   human peers to easily predict the final intention of a robotic movement.
   Here, we present a novel motion planning algorithm, the Human-like
   Upper-limb Motion Planner, for the upper limb of anthropomorphic robots,
   that generates collision-free trajectories with human-like
   characteristics. Mainly inspired from established theories of human
   motor control, the planning process takes into account a task-dependent
   hierarchy of spatial and postural constraints modelled as cost
   functions. For experimental validation, we generate arm-hand
   trajectories in a series of tasks including simple point-to-point
   reaching movements and sequential object-manipulation paradigms. Being a
   major contribution to the current literature, specific focus is on the
   kinematics of naturalistic arm movements during the avoidance of
   obstacles. To evaluate human-likeness, we observe kinematic regularities
   and adopt smoothness measures that are applied in human motor control
   studies to distinguish between well-coordinated and impaired movements.
   The results of this study show that the proposed algorithm is capable of
   planning arm-hand movements with human-like kinematic features at a
   computational cost that allows fluent and efficient human-robot
   interactions.},

Abstract = {How to generate anthropomorphic reaching movement remains a challenging
   problem in service robots and human motor function repair/reconstruction
   equipment. However, there is no universally accepted computational model
   in the literature for reproducing the motion of the human upper limb. In
   response to the problem, this article presents a computational framework
   for generating reaching movement endowed with human motion
   characteristics that imitated the mechanism in the control and
   realization of human upper limb motions. This article first establishes
   the experimental paradigm of human upper limb functional movements and
   proposes the characterization of human upper limb movement
   characteristics and feature movement clustering methods in the joint
   space. Then, according to the specific task requirements of the upper
   limb, combined with the human sensorimotor model, the estimation method
   of the human upper limb natural postures was established. Next, a
   continuous task parametric model matching the characteristic motion
   class is established by using the Gaussian mixture regression method.
   The anthropomorphic motion generation method with the characteristics of
   the smooth trajectory and the ability of natural obstacle avoidance is
   proposed. Finally, the anthropomorphic motion generation method proposed
   in this article is verified by a human-like robot. The measurement index
   of the human-likeness degree of the trajectory is given. The
   experimental results show that for all four tested tasks, the
   human-likeness degrees were greater than 90.8\%, and the trajectories'
   jerk generated by this method is very similar to the trajectories' jerk
   of humans, which validates the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Robots with human-like appearances and structures are usually well
   accepted in the human-robot interaction. However, compared with
   human-like appearances and structures, the human-like motion plays a
   much more critical role in improving the efficiency and safety of the
   human-robot interaction. This paper develops a human-like motion planner
   based on human arm motion patterns (HAMPs) to fulfill the human-robot
   object handover tasks. First, a handover task is divided into two
   sub-tasks, that is, pick-up and delivery, and HAMPs are extracted for
   these two sub-tasks separately. The resulting HAMPs are analyzed, and a
   method is proposed to select HAMPs that can represent the
   characteristics of the human arm motion. Then the factors affecting the
   duration of the movement primitives are analyzed, and the relationship
   between the duration of the movement primitives and these factors is
   determined. Based on the selected HAMP and the computed duration of the
   movement primitives, a human-like motion planning framework is developed
   to generate the human-like motion for the robotic arms. Finally, this
   motion planner is verified by the human-robot handover experiments using
   a KUKA IIWA robot. It shows that the resulting trajectories can
   correctly reflect the relative relationship between the joints in the
   human arm motion and are very close to the recorded human arm
   trajectories. Furthermore, the proposed motion planning method is
   compared with the motion planning method based on minimum total
   potential energy. The results show that the proposed method can generate
   more human-like motion.},

Abstract = {Given the significant potential for robot-assisted rehabilitation,
   developing well-planned trajectories plays a crucial role in enhancing
   the effectiveness of such rehabilitation methods. A critical aspect of
   this field, particularly concerning the movement of the human upper
   limb, is the redundancy resolution. In this study, we introduce a novel
   trajectory planning method aimed at addressing the redundancy resolution
   in reaching motions related to Activities of Daily Living (ADL). This
   method is inspired by prior studies on maximum manipulability while
   emphasizing the natural upper limb posture, particularly the human
   preference for maintaining a nearly steady elbow position during ADL
   movements unless, of course, the range of the desired motion requires
   otherwise. A trajectory-combining approach is developed for generating
   trajectories in the human configuration space. Additionally, we present
   a configuration transformation model for human-robot configuration
   alignment. Experimental results validate the hypothesis of a steady
   elbow position and combine features from the Minimum Jerk (MJ) and
   Minimum Angular Jerk (MAJ) methods, demonstrating more natural reaching
   motions. The configuration transformation model has been successfully
   tested on the TAMU CLEVERarm, a lightweight and compact upper limb
   exoskeleton.},

Abstract = {The motor synergy pattern is an intrinsic characteristic found in
   natural human movements, particularly in the upper limb. It is essential
   to improve the multijoint coordination ability for stroke patients by
   integrating the synergy pattern into rehabilitation tasks and trajectory
   design. However, current robot-assisted rehabilitation systems tend to
   overlook the incorporation of a multijoint synergy model. This article
   proposes postural synergistic kernelized movement primitives (PSKMP)
   method for the human-like trajectory planning of robot-assisted upper
   limb rehabilitation. First, the demonstrated trajectory obtained from
   the motion capture system is subject to principal component analysis to
   extract postural synergies. Then, the PSKMP is proposed by kernelizing
   the postural synergistic subspaces with the kernel treatment to preserve
   human natural movement characteristics. Finally, the rehabilitation
   trajectory accord with human motion habits can be generated based on
   generalized postural synergistic subspaces. This approach has undergone
   practical validation on an upper limb rehabilitation robot, and the
   experimental results show that the proposed method enables the
   generation of human-like trajectories adapted to new task points, in
   accordance with the natural movement style of human. This method holds
   great significance in promoting the recovery of coordination ability of
   stroke patients.},

Title = {Towards autonomous ergonomic upper-limb exoskeletons: A computational
   approach for planning a human-like path},
Journal = {ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {145},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Computational path planning approaches can enable development of
   autonomous rehabilitation and assistive exoskeletons. Using a human-like
   reference behavior for such wearable systems can ensure safe, effective,
   and intuitive human-robot interaction. This is of significant importance
   since the quality of interaction and ergonomic considerations have a
   substantial effect on technology usability and acceptance by the users.
   This paper proposes a novel framework for generating human-like paths
   for wearable exoskeletons in the shoulder-elbow level. The introduced
   method is a two-stage process where a human-like reference path is
   planned in the configuration space of the human arm, followed by an
   analytical transformation that directly maps the derived path to the
   configuration space of the exoskeleton. The analytical mapping presented
   is a function of the kinematic parameters of the system and can be
   adapted for other upper-limb exoskeletons. As a case study, the proposed
   method is used for generating human-like reference motions for a
   six-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton supporting scapulohumeral rhythm,
   glenohumeral rotations, and elbow flexion/extension. Firstly, it is
   shown that reaching motions associated with activities of daily living
   can be predicted with high accuracy in the human joint space. This is
   demonstrated by analyzing the experimental data collected from healthy
   subjects. Subsequently, it is verified through kinematic analysis that
   the transformation of generated paths to the exoskeleton configuration
   space does not alter their spatial profile in the task space. (C) 2021

   simulate the movements of human arms accurately. The Bayesian decision
   is used to make robotic arms choose an appropriate mode of motion. The

Abstract = {In this paper, the human-like motion issue for anthropomorphic arms is
   further discussed. An Intelligent Human-like Motion Planner (IHMP)
   consisting of Movement Primitive (MP), Bayesian Network (BN) and
   Coupling Neural Network (CPNN) is proposed to help the robot generate
   human-like arm movements. Firstly, the arm motion model is decoupled in
   the aspects of arm structure and motion process, respectively. In the
   former aspect, the arm model is decoupled into different simple models
   through the Movement Primitive. A Hierarchical Planning Strategy (HPS)
   is proposed to decouple a complete motion process into different
   sub-processes. Based on diversified arm motion models, the Bayesian
   Network is used to help the robot choose the suitable motion model among
   these arm motion models. Then, according to the features of diversified
   arm motion models, the Coupling Neural Network is proposed to obtain the
   inverse kinematic (IK) solutions. This network can integrate different
   models into a single network and reflect the features of these models by
   changing the network structure. Being a major contribution to this
   paper, specific focus is on the improvement of human-like motion

Abstract = {A novel motion planning method is proposed to generate human-like motion
   for anthropomorphic robot arms. Its highlight is to consider the robot
   arm to be human-like not only in its configuration but also in its
   motion patterns. To achieve this, the intrinsic mechanisms of human arm
   motion generation are transferred to robot motion planning. First, human
   arm motion is modeled using human arm motion primitives. The mechanisms
   of human arm motion generation are dissected from a large number of
   motion samples, reflected in the types, sequencing and quantification
   rules/laws of the primitives. Next, the human arm motion patterns are
   studied based on primitive chains. Finally, a new motion planning method
   is built that autonomously performs motion pattern decisions, motion
   time allocation, and joint trajectory generation. The proposed method is
   validated by a motion planning app and a robot simulation.},

Abstract = {During the communication and interaction with a human using motions or
   gestures, a humanoid robot needs to not only look like a human but also
   behavior like a human to avoid confusions in the communication and
   interaction. Among human-like behaviors, arm motions of the humanoid
   robot are essential for the communication with people through motions.
   In this work, a mathematical representation for characterizing human arm
   motions is first proposed. The human arm motions are characterized by
   the elbow elevation angle that is determined using the position and
   orientation of human hands. That representation is mathematically
   obtained using an approximation tool, Response Surface Method (RSM).
   Then a method to generate human-like arm motions in real time using the
   proposed representation is presented. The proposed method was evaluated
   to generate human-like arm motions when the humanoid robot was asked to
   move its arms from a point to another point including the rotation of
   hand. An example motion was performed using the KIST humanoid robot,
   MAHRU.},

Abstract = {Background Human-likeliness of robot movements is a key component to
   enable a safe and effective human-robot interaction, since it
   contributes to increase acceptance and motion predictability of robots
   that have to closely interact with people, e.g. for assistance and
   rehabilitation purposes. Several parameters have been used to quantify
   how much a robot behaves like a human, which encompass aspects related
   to both the robot appearance and motion. The latter point is fundamental
   to allow the operator to interpret robotic actions, and plan a
   meaningful reactions. While different approaches have been presented in
   literature, which aim at devising bio-aware control guidelines, a direct
   implementation of human actions for robot planning is not
   straightforward, still representing an open issue in robotics. Methods
   We propose to embed a synergistic representation of human movements for
   robot motion generation. To do this, we recorded human upper-limb
   motions during daily living activities. We used functional Principal
   Component Analysis (fPCA) to extract principal motion patterns. We then
   formulated the planning problem by optimizing the weights of a reduced
   set of these components. For free-motions, our planning method results
   into a closed form solution which uses only one principal component. In
   case of obstacles, a numerical routine is proposed, incrementally
   enrolling principal components until the problem is solved with a
   suitable precision. Results Results of fPCA show that more than 80\% of
   the observed variance can be explained by only three functional
   components. The application of our method to different meaningful
   movements, with and without obstacles, show that our approach is able to
   generate complex motions with a very reduced number of functional
   components. We show that the first synergy alone accounts for the 96\%
   of cost reduction and that three components are able to achieve a
   satisfactory motion reconstruction in all the considered cases.
   Conclusions In this work we moved from the analysis of human movements
   via fPCA characterization to the design of a novel human-like motion
   generation algorithm able to generate, efficiently and with a reduced
   set of basis elements, several complex movements in free space, both in
   free motion and in case of obstacle avoidance tasks.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a planning procedure that allows an anthropomorphic
   dual-arm robotic system to perform a manipulation task in a natural
   human-like way by using demonstrated human movements. The key idea of
   the proposal is to convert the demonstrated trajectories into attractive
   potential fields defined over the configuration space and then use an
   RRT{*}-based planning algorithm that minimizes a path-cost function
   designed to bias the tree growth toward the human-demonstrated
   configurations. This paper presents a description of the proposed
   approach as well as results from a conceptual and a real application
   example, the latter using a real anthropomorphic dual-arm robotic
   system. A path-quality measure, based on first-order synergies
   (correlations between joint velocities) obtained from real human
   movements, is also proposed and used for evaluation and comparison
   purposes. The obtained results show that the paths obtained with the
   proposed procedure are more human-like.},

Abstract = {This article presents a dual fast marching tree algorithm that consists
   of constrained fast marching tree planning in a Cartesian space
   (C\_FMT{*}) and human-like fast marching tree planning in self-motion
   manifolds (H\_FMT{*}) for human-like motion planning for anthropomorphic
   arms with task constraints. The key idea of the proposal is to exploit
   dual sampling in a Cartesian space and self-motion manifolds to explore
   the entire configuration space. The C\_FMT{*} reduces the constrained
   planning problem to the unconstrained instance by sampling in the
   obstacle-free Cartesian space and satisfying the task constraints; it
   can solve most of these constrained path planning tasks quickly and
   obtain lower cost solutions compared to the existing techniques. In
   addition, a validity checking method of Cartesian sampling points based
   on self-motion manifolds is introduced to ensure the probabilistic
   completeness of the new planner. By analyzing musculoskeletal models of
   the human arm and the muscle strength property, a torque effort
   criterion was deduced to generate biomimetic motion for anthropomorphic
   arms. Then, an H\_FMT{*} that incorporates the FMT{*} algorithm with the
   torque effort criterion is also proposed and used to bias the tree
   growth toward human-like movements in the self-motion manifolds of the
   obtained path. Finally, the proposed approach has been illustrated with
   several real examples executed with a humanoid robot. The obtained
   results show that the paths obtained with the proposed approach are
   quicker and more human-like.},

Abstract = {In this work we introduce a new type of human-inspired upper-limb
   prostheses. The Artificial Neuromuscular Prosthesis (ANP) imitates the
   human neuromuscular system in the sense of its compliance,
   backdrivability, natural motion, proprioceptive sensing, and
   kinesthetics. To realize this challenging goal, we introduce a novel
   human-inspired and simulation-based development paradigm to design the
   prosthesis mechatronics in correspondence to the human body. The ANP
   provides body awareness, contact awareness, and human-like contact
   response, realized via floating base rigid-body models, disturbance
   observers, and joint impedance control-concepts known from established
   state-of-the-art robotics. The ANP mechatronics is characterized by a
   four degrees of freedom (dof) torque-controlled human-like kinematics, a
   tendon-driven 2-dof wrist, and spatial orientation sensing at a weight
   of 1.7 kg (without hand and battery). The paper deals with the rigorous
   mathematical modeling, control, design and evaluation of this device
   type along initially defined requirements within a single prototype
   only. The proposed systemic and grasping capabilities are verified under
   laboratory conditions by an unimpaired user. Future work will increase
   the technology readiness level of the next generation device, where
   human studies with impaired users will be done.},

Abstract = {Humanoid robot is one of the most active frontiers in robotics. As the
   basic part of motion of humanoid robot, human-like motion planning is
   always one of the research hotspots and difficulties. In this paper, a
   comprehensive approach is proposed to help robot NAO generate the
   human-like arm movements. Firstly, a novel arm motion mode is built
   based on the Movement Primitives (MPs). The whole arm movement can be
   decoupled into different simple sub-movements with different motion
   models, which improves the accuracy and computational efficiency of
   human-like arm movements. Then a motion decision algorithm based on
   Bayesian Network (BN) is proposed to help robot NAO choose the suitable
   motion model among these MPs. Finally, according to the structure
   features of the MPs, the IK solutions can be classified into two
   categories: methods based on index and on geometrical constraints.
   Through the comprehensive approach, the robot NAO can generate various
   human-like arm movements with satisfactory accuracy. The availability of
   the approach is verified by similarity experiment and human-like

Abstract = {The need for users' safety and technology acceptability has incredibly
   increased with the deployment of co-bots physically interacting with
   humans in industrial settings, and for people assistance. A well-studied
   approach to meet these requirements is to ensure human-like robot
   motions. Classic solutions for anthropomorphic movement generation
   usually rely on optimization procedures, which build upon hypotheses
   devised from neuroscientific literature, or capitalize on learning
   methods. However, these approaches come with limitations, e.g. limited
   motion variability or the need for high dimensional datasets. In this
   work, we present a technique to directly embed human upper limb
   principal motion modes computed through functional analysis in the robot
   trajectory optimization. We report on the implementation with
   manipulators with redundant anthropomorphic kinematic architectures -
   although dissimilar with respect to the human model used for functional
   mode extraction - via Cartesian impedance control. In our experiments,
   we show how human trajectories mapped onto a robotic manipulator still
   exhibit the main characteristics of human-likeness, e.g. low jerk
   values. We discuss the results with respect to the state of the art, and
   their implications for advanced human-robot interaction in industrial

Abstract = {Human-like motion of robots can improve human-robot interaction and

   planning strategy is proposed to help anthropomorphic arms generate

   network (CPNN). The movement primitives are used to decouple the human

   of human-like movements. The motion-decision algorithm based on BN is
   able to predict occurrence probabilities of the motions and choose
   appropriate mode of motion. Then, a novel CPNN is proposed to solve the
   inverse kinematics problems of anthropomorphic arms. The CPNN integrates
   different models into a single network and reflects the features of
   these models by changing the network structure. Through the strategy,
   the anthropomorphic arms can generate various human-like movements with
   satisfactory accuracy. Finally, the availability of the proposed

Abstract = {Inspired from established human motor control theories, our HUMP
   algorithm plans upper-limb collisions-free movements for anthropomorphic
   systems, which show kinematic human-like features {[}1]. Related
   cognitive issues can be further resolved when robots act as they are
   familiar with their workspace and can take initiative faster than in the
   early onsets of a task. Here, a continual learning technique is proposed
   to improve the performance of the HUMP under uncertainties of the items
   in a given scenario. Given the locality of the optimization-based HUMP
   algorithm, a meaningful initial guess, predicted from similar past
   motion experiences, can significantly reduce the computational cost and
   put the robot into action arguably faster than in the first attempts of
   planning with inexperienced initial guesses. This prediction is proposed
   to be incrementally refined by an optimal locally weighted regression
   method that operates on datasets of situational features that are
   regularly updated as new movements are planned by the robot in similar
   scenarios. The proposed cyclic experiential learner is tested on the
   selection of optimal human-like target postures in a reaching task with
   a large obstacle obstructing the straight-line path towards a given
   target. Results demonstrate the capability of extracting meaningful
   situational features in few sessions of online learning with a very
   limited size of the datasets. Comparisons with simple Euclidean locally
   weighted regression and random initializations showed the capability of
   planning target configurations of better quality with less computational
   cost. The proposed approach also exhibits to be robust against the
   interferences of new incoming samples depicting slightly changed

Abstract = {At present, robots' autonomous ability is still very weak, hence
   improving the operation ability and human-robot interaction \&
   collaboration capabilities is one of the primary goals for developing
   the anthropomorphic robots. In order to improve the human-like autonomy
   of anthropomorphic robots in dynamic and unstructured environments,
   namely, predictable and human-like motion planning, this paper proposes
   an on-line motion planning method for a humanoid mobile dual-arm
   manipulator system. It involves two aspects: autonomous placement of the
   mobile base (MB) and human-like motion planning of the MB and two arms.
   In particular, the two aspects are achieved by introducing two relative
   inverse dynamic reachability maps: RiDRM and LiDRM. Since the
   construction of RiDRM and LiDRM is mainly done offline, the online
   efficiency is guaranteed. In fact, if an obstacle is detected online,
   the maps RiDRM and LiDRM are updated by only disabling the candidate
   end-poses which are in collision. Furthermore, predictable and
   human-like movements are achieved by optimizing a merit function that
   considers five criteria simultaneously. The simulation results verify
   the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Ensuring humanoid balance stability to prevent falling is one of the
   most crucial control problems in humanoid robotics and has been
   extensively studied in the past, resulting in a diverse range of balance
   recovery schemes. These balancing control methods effectively perform
   body posture control using three main motion strategies, namely: ankle,
   ankle-hip and stepping strategies. In this work we present a novel
   balance strategy which fundamentally differs from the previous methods
   as its principle is to exploit contacts with the environment to prevent
   falling rather than only performing body posture control. An uncoupled
   impedance controller for the upper body of the humanoid robot is
   combined with a lower body stabilizer, and the balancing capabilities
   are enhanced by the establishment of additional physical contacts with
   the environment. The generation of the reactive arm motion and the
   impedance regulation are discussed in details. Experimental trials with
   the humanoid robot COMAN, provided with active and passive compliance,
   demonstrate the potential of the approach and the first step towards the
   development of more human-like balancing skills using an integrated
   approach where all body parts (not only legs but also arms and hands)
   can establish contacts with the surrounding environment so as to ensure
   a stable and balanced behavior.},

Abstract = {In this work, we propose a method for trajectory implementation based on
   the Learning by Demonstrations approach to deal with trajectory planning
   issues in upper-limb rehabilitation exoskeletons. Currently applied
   path-planning methods use mathematical trajectories or Teach-and-play
   approaches. The former do not propose human-like movements to patients,
   which is crucial to induce correct motor relearning. Moreover, they
   often differ from therapists' expectations of how movements should be
   executed, reducing the acceptability and use of exoskeletons in
   hospitals. The latter, using a single filtered trajectory demonstration,
   better meet therapists' expectations but lack consistency and
   optimization. In our approach, we employed Hidden Markov Models, still
   never used for rehabilitation robotics, to study a set of demonstrations
   and we optimized the results to respect physiological muscular
   activation patterns. Recorded few repetitions of a movement from the
   interaction of a therapist with an exoskeleton, our
   machine-learning-based algorithm returns a ready-to-use trajectory
   representing the therapist's desires. We tested our method on a 4
   degrees-of-freedom exoskeleton to record 5 exercises, interacting with 5
   therapists. Comparing our trajectories with those obtained with
   literature methods, we see that our approach produces better kinematic
   and human-likeness results, and is better according to the global
   opinion expressed by the therapists.},

Abstract = {A conversion process for the imitation of human dual-arm motion by a

   analysis shows that our algorithm, which takes into account the
   situation of marker frames and the position of joint frames, ensures
   more precise imitation than previously proposed methods. The results of

Abstract = {Task planning has an important effect on the anthropomorphic
   characteristics of the motion of the humanoid robot. In this paper,
   human-like task planning for a dual-arm robot is discussed. A bottom-up
   task planning approach is proposed based on the motion primitives which
   imply the features of human motion, in order to obtain a human-like
   motion fundamentally. Unlike the traditional methods which decompose the
   task into a sequence of well-designed trajectories of the end-effector
   in task space, we ignore the trajectory planning temporarily, and
   assemble the motion primitives until the task is accomplished.
   Therefore, the human-like posture is guaranteed all the time, and there
   is no need to spend much time in solving the inverse kinematics of
   redundant manipulators and performing an optimization for a human-like
   posture. Two basic and specific tasks are analyzed based on the proposed
   approach. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the validation
   and feasibility, and the characteristics of the planned motion are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new multimodal architecture for gaze-independent
   brain-computer interface (BCI)-driven control of a robotic upper limb
   exoskeleton for stroke rehabilitation to provide active assistance in
   the execution of reaching tasks in a real setting scenario. At the level
   of action plan, the patient's intention is decoded by means of an active
   vision system, through the combination of a Kinect-based vision system,
   which can online robustly identify and track 3-D objects, and an
   eye-tracking system for objects selection. At the level of action
   generation, a BCI is used to control the patient's intention to move
   his/her own arm, on the basis of brain activity analyzed during motor
   imagery. The main kinematic parameters of the reaching movement (i.e.,
   speed, acceleration, and jerk) assisted by the robot are modulated by
   the output of the BCI classifier so that the robot-assisted movement is
   performed under a continuous control of patient's brain activity. The
   system was experimentally evaluated in a group of three healthy
   volunteers and four chronic stroke patients. Experimental results show
   that all subjects were able to operate the exoskeleton movement by BCI
   with a classification error rate of 89.4 +/- 5.0\% in the robot-assisted
   condition, with no difference of the performance observed in stroke
   patients compared with healthy subjects. This indicates the high
   potential of the proposed gaze-BCI-driven robotic assistance for
   neurorehabilitation of patients with motor impairments after stroke
   since the earliest phase of recovery.},

Abstract = {The robot manipulation in human environment is a challenging issue
   because the human environment is complex, dynamic, unstructured, and

   applications in our daily lives, robots need to perform manipulation
   tasks within human environment. Particularly for a humanoid robot, the
   manipulability of the objects is essential to assist the humans in human

   with both arms of a humanoid robot. We focus on the generation of
   human-like movements by using the human motion capture data. Then, the
   control method based on the virtual dynamics model is proposed to
   control both the motion and force under the uniform control system. This
   method empowers the robot to perform the object manipulation task
   including reaching, grasping, and moving an object in sequence. The
   proposed algorithm is implemented on a humanoid robot with independent
   joint controller at each motor; its performance is demonstrated by

Abstract = {How to generate human-like arm extension motion is a challenging problem
   in the process of human-robot collaboration to understand and judge the
   robot's motion intention. To address this problem, this paper proposes a
   multi-task planning algorithm for human-like arm motion based on the
   energy principle and the joint limit avoidance principle. First, a
   motion capture device is used to collect human arm motion data to obtain
   guidelines for human arm motion characteristics. On the basis of
   analyzing the arm demonstration data, the gravitational potential energy
   and virtual elastic potential energy models of the arm are established,
   and the mapping from the virtual variable stiffness of the arm to the
   virtual variable stiffness of the robot is realized. An end-effector
   trajectory is generated based on a dynamic movement primitives (DMPs)
   model and an optimization method, while a spherical linear interpolation
   (slerp) algorithm is used to generate the attitude sequence. In order to
   better execute the planned motion, the priority of the motion task is
   divided, and the design of two priority motion tasks is carried out by
   combining the gradient projection method. Finally, the humanoid arm
   motion multi-task planning algorithm proposed in this paper is simulated
   by simulation experiments, and the experimental results show that the
   method can generate the corresponding humanoid motions and has better
   motion accuracy.},

   structure and motion expression of the human arm. A method to slice the
   complex tasks into simple subtasks and sort subtasks is proposed. Then,
   a novel human-like motion planning method is built through the
   selection, sequencing and quantification of HAMPs. Finally, the HAMPs
   are mapped to the traditional joint angles of a robot by an analytical
   inverse kinematics method to control the anthropomorphic arms. Findings
   For the exploration of the motion laws of the human arm, the human arm
   motion capture experiments on 12 subjects are performed. The results
   show that the motion laws of human arm are reflected in the selection,
   sequencing and quantification of HAMPs. These motion laws can facilitate
   the human-like motion planning of anthropomorphic arms.
   Originality/value This study presents the HAMPs and a method for
   selecting, sequencing and quantifying them in human-like style, which
   leads to a new motion planning method for the anthropomorphic arms. A
   similar methodology is suitable for robots with anthropomorphic arms
   such as service robots, upper extremity exoskeleton robots and humanoid
   robots.},

Abstract = {A high redundant non-holonomic humanoid mobile dual-arm manipulator
   system (MDAMS) is presented in this paper, where the motion planning to
   realize ``human-like{''} autonomous navigation and manipulation tasks is
   studied. First, an improved MaxiMin NSGA-II algorithm, which optimizes
   five objective functions to solve the problems of singularity,
   redundancy and coupling between mobile base and manipulator
   simultaneously, is proposed to design the optimal pose to manipulate the
   target object. Then, in order to link the initial pose and that optimal
   pose, an off-line motion planning algorithm is designed. In detail, an
   efficient direct-connect bidirectional RRT and gradient descent
   algorithm is proposed to reduce the sampled nodes largely, and a
   geometric optimization method is proposed for path pruning. Besides,
   head forward behaviors are realized by calculating the reasonable
   orientations and assigning them to the mobile base to improve the
   quality of human-robot interaction. Third, the extension to online
   planning is done by introducing real-time sensing, collision-test and
   control cycles to update robotic motion in dynamic environments. Fourth,
   an EEs' via-point-based multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is
   proposed to design the ``human-like{''} via-poses by optimizing four
   objective functions. Finally, numerous simulations are presented to
   validate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.},

Abstract = {Upper extremity exoskeleton rehabilitation robots have become a
   significant piece of rehabilitation equipment, and planning their motion
   trajectories is essential in patient rehabilitation. In this paper, a
   multistrategy improved whale optimization algorithm (MWOA) is proposed
   for trajectory planning of upper extremity exoskeleton rehabilitation
   robots with emphasis on isokinetic rehabilitation. First, a piecewise
   polynomial was used to construct a rough trajectory. To make the
   trajectory conform to human-like movement, a whale optimization
   algorithm (WOA) was employed to generate a bounded jerk trajectory with
   the minimum running time as the objective. The search performance of the
   WOA under complex constraints, including the search capability of
   trajectory planning symmetry, was improved by the following strategies:
   a dual-population search, including a new communication mechanism to
   prevent falling into the local optimum; a mutation centroid
   opposition-based learning, to improve the diversity of the population;
   and an adaptive inertia weight, to balance exploration and exploitation.
   Simulation analysis showed that the MWOA generated a trajectory with a
   shorter run-time and better symmetry and robustness than the WOA.
   Finally, a pilot rehabilitation session on a healthy volunteer using an
   upper extremity exoskeleton rehabilitation robot was completed safely
   and smoothly along the trajectory planned by the MWOA. The proposed
   algorithm thus provides a feasible scheme for isokinetic rehabilitation
   trajectory planning of upper extremity exoskeleton rehabilitation
   robots.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of designing a planning algorithm for
   anthropomorphic dual-arm robotic systems to find paths that mimics the
   movements of real human beings by using first-order synergies
   (correlations between joint velocities). The key idea of the proposal is
   to convert captured human movements into a vector field of velocities,
   defined in the configuration space of the robot, and use it to guide the
   search of a solution path. The motion planning is solved using the
   proposed algorithm, called FOS-BKPIECE, that is a bidirectional version
   of the KPIECE planner working with an improved version of the extension
   procedure of the VF-RRT planner. The obtained robot movements follow the
   directions of the defined vector field and hence allow the robot to
   solve the task in a human-like fashion. The paper presents a description
   of the proposed approach as well as results from conceptual and
   application examples, the latter using a real anthropomorphic dual-arm
   robotic system. A thorough comparison with other previous planning
   algorithms shows that the proposed approach obtains better results. (C)

   WABIAN-2R has two 1-DOF passive joints in its feet to enable it to bend

   the foot trajectories of a biped robot are optimized by using a genetic
   algorithm in order to generate a continuous and smooth leg motion.

Abstract = {In assistive robotics, a manipulator arm constitutes one possible
   solution for restoring some manipulation functions to victims of upper
   limb disabilities. The aim of this paper is to present a global strategy
   of approach of an assistive mobile manipulator (manipulator arm mounted
   on a mobile base). A manipulability criterion is defined to deal with
   the redundancy of the system. The aim is to keep the arm manipulable,
   i.e. capable of moving by itself. The strategy is based on human-like
   behaviour to help the disabled operator to understand the action of the
   robot. When the robot is far from its objective, only the mobile base
   moves, thus avoiding obstacles if necessary. When the objective is close
   to the robot, both mobile base and arm move and redundancy can be used
   to maximise a manipulability criterion. All the situations are tested
   separately and a global mission is realised in which all the previous
   situations are encountered. The partial results obtained with the real
   robot consolidate the results of simulation. This paper does not propose
   an autonomous path planning and navigation of the mobile arm but an
   assistance to the user for remote controlling it. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {In industry 4.0, to increase flexibility of a robotic arm system,
   high-DOFs (degrees of freedom) robotic arm system is used for different

   control is to utilize kinesthetic teaching in Cartesian space by guiding
   the robot's end-effector to targets. Usually, the teaching process takes
   a long time, and the configuration of the robotic arm makes them only
   workable for specific application needs. This research presents a novel
   mechanical design of 7-DOFs humanoid robotic arm and an algorithm to
   generate human-like motions for the anthropometric robotic arm to solve
   the problem. Because the humanoid robotic arm exists one redundant DOF,
   in this paper, this extra DOF is utilized to optimize the human-like
   motion in performing tasks with minimum angle variance, adjusting force
   transmission with manipulability ellipsoids, and avoiding obstacles in

Abstract = {Because of their unique adaptability, flexibility, and robustness,
   musculoskeletal robotic systems are regarded potentially as
   next-generation robots. However, motion learning and generation of such
   a robotic system are still challenging. This paper presents a
   neuromuscular control method, namely, TMS-PPO, based on time-varying
   muscle synergy (TMS) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). The
   electromyogram (EMG) activation signals of actual human motions are
   decomposed to obtain TMSs based on the temporal properties of the TMS.
   The weights of networks are trained to generate the scale and phase
   coefficients through the PPO. The coefficients modulate the TMSs to
   generate appropriate activation patterns to optimize motion learning of
   the musculoskeletal system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed
   method, the TMSs are extracted from human upper limb muscle activation
   signals, and we compare TMS-PPO with PPO in the motion learning and
   generation process of an upper limb musculoskeletal system. The results
   show that TMS-PPO can complete the control tasks because the average
   errors of the joints are less than 0.05 rad. In the meantime, TMSs are
   used as motion primitives of the musculoskeletal system to simulate the
   process of the human CNS controlling muscles. It shows that TMS-PPO
   reduces the energy consumption and improves the learning rate
   significantly compared with the PPO. The learning episodes reduce from
   104 to 103, which indicates that TMS-PPO has a stronger learning ability
   and better physiological explanation.
   Note to Practitioners-Due to the superiorities of the musculoskeletal
   system, humanoid robots that imitate human driven mechanisms are
   vigorously carried out worldwide. Taking advantages of human-like
   characteristics, the musculoskeletal robot provides new opportunities to
   understand and validate the human mechanisms of muscle control and
   motion learning, to compare the performance of the robot to that of
   humans as well as work in real world, e.g., human interactive robots,
   amusement robots and medical training robots in the future. However,
   strong redundancy, coupling, and nonlinearity of the system also raises
   many challenges for the investigation of the control problem. Inspired
   by how the human CNS controls a musculoskeletal system and realize
   motion generalization, a novel muscle-synergiesbased neuromuscular
   control that combines time-varying muscle synergy (TMS) and Proximal
   Policy Optimization (PPO), namely, TMS-PPO is proposed in this paper.
   The learning efficiency of PPO and the physiological interpretation of
   the control process are improved during the motion learning and
   generation processes of the musculoskeletal system. Preliminary
   simulation experiments suggest that this method is feasible in terms of
   control accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, the performance of the
   TMS-PPO is comparable to the PPO without significant improvement. To
   solve this problem, in future work, we will introduce the cerebellar
   model into the control method which plays the role of adjusting and
   correcting the motions of the limbs to achieve accurate and stable
   control in the actions process of humans.},

Abstract = {At present, industrial robot arms have been widely applied in actual
   production. Especially for some human-robot cooperation work scenarios,
   involving the interaction between human and robot in sharing workspace,
   the requirement of trajectory planning for safety and natural
   interaction was more demanded. Aiming to solve the problems of the
   complex planning of trajectory and low security of man-machine
   cooperation, this paper introduced a control method of human-like
   trajectory based on the k-nearest neighbors. By using the Kinect
   equipment, the trajectories of wrist joint of human arm were acquired
   during manipulation tasks and then the k-nearest neighbors algorithm was
   adopted to analyze the trajectories. Consequently, the control laws of
   human-like trajectory of robot end-effecter are extracted based on the
   collected motion data. The corresponding experiments are conducted to
   verify the proposed method and this method can generate the human-like
   trajectory for robot manipulators, avoiding the collision with human arm
   and obstacles. It also enhances the performance of security and makes
   robots more human-robot friendly.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a robotic motion planning scheme is proposed to generate
   hand-over motions in a friendly and comfortable manner. Two sub-problems
   are studied: The determination of the final target position (where the
   robot should hand over the object to) and the generation of human-like
   motion in the hand-over process (how the robot should hand over the
   object to the position). First, experiments of different subjects are
   conducted to explore the common characteristics in the optimal hand-over
   positions. The result shows that their joint angles are similar at the
   optimal hand-over position. Therefore, the optimal hand-over position
   can be determined by forward kinematics based on the measured average
   joint angles. Then, two methods are proposed to plan the human-like
   hand-over motions in an obstacle-free environment and in an
   obstacle-present environment, respectively. A series of experimental
   comparisons is conducted to prove the validity of the methods. A robotic
   arm is controlled to hand over a cube to humans in human-like way and
   nonhuman-like way. The subjects are asked to grade the hand-over motion
   of the robotic arm on a scale of 1 to 5. The results show that the
   hand-over motions planned by the methods proposed in this paper can make
   people feel safer and more comfortable.},

Abstract = {A human model of a dynamic overarm throwing motion is evaluated in this
   work with novel motion primitives including determinants, key frames,

   of overarm throwing from five subjects are used for motion primitives.
   The evaluation process uses combined qualitative key frames

   potential application in simulating human-like throwing strategies and
   humanoid motion planning and control. Significant correlation between
   the generated and experimental GRFs with R-2 = 0.90 and 0.82 were found
   for the right and left feet, respectively, and the total vertical GRF
   calculated from the model was approximately equal to the weight of the

   right elbow flexion showed near perfect correlation with R-2 values
   larger than 0.90, while the right shoulder abduction, left hip
   abduction, and left hip rotation showed moderate correlations with R-2

Abstract = {Movement generation in robotics is an old problem with many excellent
   solutions. Most of them, however, look for optimality according to some
   metrics, but have no biological inspiration or cannot be used to imitate
   biological motion. For a human these techniques behave in a
   non-naturalistic way. This poses a problem for instance in human-robot
   interaction and, in general, for a good acceptance of robots in society.
   The present work presents a new analysis of the attractor dynamics
   approach to movement generation used in an anthropomorphic robot arm.
   Our analysis points to the possibility of using this approach to
   generate human-like arm trajectories in robots. One key property of
   human trajectories in pick-and-place tasks is the planarity of the
   trajectory of the end effector in 3D space. We show that this feature is
   also displayed by the attractor dynamic approach and, therefore, is a
   good candidate to the generation of naturalistic arm movements.},

Abstract = {Autonomic mobile base (MB)'s location \& upper-body's configuration
   design and control are two of the fundamental issues to realize robotic
   autonomy. Besides, the human-like behaviors capacity is essential for
   human-robot interaction scenarios. Thus, to achieve human-like autonomy,
   this paper proposes a motion planning and tracking strategy for a
   redundant dual-arm humanoid mobile manipulator system. Specifically, the
   inverse dynamic reachability map (iDRM), the improved MaxiMin NSGA-II
   and the direct-connect bidirectional RRT \& gradient descent algorithms
   are employed. Firstly, iRM is constructed and used to design potential
   MB's location area. Then, the improved MaxiMin NSGA-II algorithm is used
   to determine the desired end-pose based on the selected MB's location
   area. After the desired end-pose is designed, the direct-connect
   bidirectional RRT \& gradient descent algorithm will be used to generate
   the approaching trajectory from the initial pose to the desired
   end-pose. Finally, the RBFNN controller is used to track the planned
   trajectory. On the other hand, if there are new obstacles, iDRM will be
   obtained by updating iRM. iRM and iDRM accelerate the desired end-pose
   design by narrowing MB's searching area. Moreover, to achieve human-like
   motions five criteria including the end-effectors' (EE) displacement
   with respect to MB are proposed. Several motion planning simulations are
   realized that validate the proposed strategy.},

Title = {A Hybrid Joint/Cartesian DMP-Based Approach for Obstacle Avoidance of
   Anthropomorphic Assistive Robots},

Abstract = {Anthropomorphic criteria are widely adopted for developing socially
   interactive robots since they can improve human capability to interpret
   and predict robot motion, with an impact on robot acceptability and
   human-robot interaction safety. Learning by demonstration approaches
   based on dynamic movement primitives are a suitable solution for
   planning the robot motion in human-like fashion and endow robots with
   generalization capabilities and robustness against perturbation.
   Objective of this work is to propose a new formulation of the learning
   by demonstration approach based on dynamic movement primitives (DMPs),
   called hybrid joint/Cartesian DMPs, for redundant robots with the
   twofold purpose of avoiding obstacles on the path and obtaining
   anthropomorphic motion in the joint as well as the task space. The
   proposed approach, suitable for assistive purposes, was experimentally
   validated on the anthropomorphic robot arm Kuka Light Weight Robot 4+.
   Trajectories recorded by an optoelectronic system (i.e. the BTS Smart D)
   from human demonstrators performing point-to-point reaching and pouring
   tasks were adopted to teach the robot how to move. A comparative
   analysis with current methods of learning by demonstration in the
   literature, i.e. Cartesian DMP and inverse kinematics, was performed.
   Performance indicators were introduced to (1) assess the robot accuracy
   of the motion performing, (2) evaluate the level of anthropomorphism of
   the computed motion, (3) measure the success rate in obstacle avoidance.
   Moreover, questionnaires were administered to ten human subjects who
   observed robot motion. The obtained results demonstrated that the
   proposed approach guarantees anthropomorphic motion of the robot both in
   the joint and in the task spaces ensuring obstacle avoidance along the
   robot kinematic chain. In particular, the anthropomorphic robot, while
   operating with the proposed method, exhibits behaviours in the joint
   space that are similar to the one recorded during the demonstration and
   has a level of anthropomorphism rather higher than the one obtained with
   Cartesian DMP and inverse kinematics (a configuration of the robot
   joints within the physiological limits is always ensured and the maximum
   convex hull created between the human and the robot arm is 0.0085 m(3)).
   In presence of obstacles, an acceptable level of the Cartesian accuracy
   (Position err < 0.005m and Orientation err < 0.02 rad) is achieved. The
   obstacles are avoided with a 100\% of success. The questionnaire results
   showed that the users feel more comfortable and less nervous to interact
   with a robot that moves in human-like manner.},

   each arm is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a virtual plane
   approach is employed to generate the analytical solution of the head
   motion. A quadratic program (QP)-based method is exploited to formulate
   the coordinated dual-arm motion. To obtain the optimal solution, a
   simplified recurrent neural network is used to solve the QP problem. The

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for anthropomorphic dual-arm robots

   Unlike conventional methods in which the trajectory of the transported
   object is explicitly prescribed in the operational space, the proposed
   method plans the motion upon intrinsic variables from both arms and
   produce the trajectory in an indirect way. Thus, the proposed method is
   a model-based ``joint space{''} method and exploits the coordination of
   the arms in the motion planning procedure. The motion planning is
   divided into translation planning and orientation stabilization. Only
   the final positions of the wrist centers need to be specified for
   translation planning; the object's orientation will adapt following the
   translation. Simulation is conducted to verify the feasibility of the
   proposed method. Comparison with the conventional method is performed to
   demonstrate the features of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a semantic synthesis method that enables robots to
   generate human-like gestures by recognizing cognitive and emotional
   behaviors based on a given situation. Assuming that the human cognitive
   process is represented as a series of associated events, we proposed a
   virtually touchable space associated with robotic hands. Additionally,
   in a humanoid robot, the motions of two arms are considered as a crucial
   non-verbal communication channel because large spatial changes capture
   the attention of a human agent. Additionally, virtual spaces related to
   certain events are described by robotic hands. The concept of virtual
   spaces is tested with regard to the expression of the robot's cognitive
   process with a combination of predefined motion sets.},

Abstract = {Collaboration between humans and robots is an important aspect of
   Industry 4.0. It can be improved by incorporating human-like
   characteristics into robot motion planning. It is assumed that humans
   move optimal with respect to a certain objective or cost function. To
   find this function, also for a robot, we use an inverse optimal control
   approach identifying what linear weighted combination of physically
   interpretable cost functions best mimics human point-to-point motions. A
   bi-level optimization is used, where the upper level compares the
   optimal robot result of the lower level with human reference motions.
   Two depth cameras are combined in a setup to record these reference
   motions.
   The resulting weighted cost functions are then used to generate new
   motions for a seven degrees of freedom robot arm. The resulting
   optimized motions are compared to standard robot motions based on linear
   interpolation in joint or task space. The comparison is performed by
   means of a small experiment where preliminary observations show that
   humans experience these motions as more anthropomorphic and feel at
   least equally comfortable and safe compared to existing motion planning
   strategies. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

   Robot},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {7},
Pages = {14366-14377},
Abstract = {A variable stiffness actuator is inspired by the human motor control and
   is the most popular actuator used to exploit the human performance and
   human-like motion. However, these actuators are typically highly
   non-linear and redundant not only in their kinematics but also in their
   dynamics due to their capability to modulate their stiffness and
   positions simultaneously. It is not trivial to generate the trajectory
   for a strongly non-linear and redundant dynamic system equipped with
   variable stiffness actuators. In this paper, a trajectory planning
   method for a variable stiffness actuated robot via a time-energy optimal
   control policy is proposed. The simulation studies demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the trajectory planning method through the case studies
   of a two degree of freedom variable stiffness actuated robot.
   Furthermore, the results show that the proposed method could be able to
   generate the motion which is similar to the human arm motion strategy.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, robots are more and more autonomous, they are able to
   investigate autonomously the surrounding environment, take decisions,
   and, of course, accomplish elaborated tasks receiving simple inputs by
   users. Generally, every robot has to move to interact with the
   environment and human users replicating human-like motions and
   decisions. The literature already gives a lot of documentation about
   mobile/flying robots spanning paths in 2D and 3D environments, while the
   motion of articulated arms in 3D environments still requires
   investigation and experiments. This paper investigates MoveIt!, one of
   the most famous motion planner software, understanding its limits and
   trying to extend its capabilities. Integrating another planner with
   MoveIt!'s planning routine to split longer actions into smaller ones
   increases planning robustness. Due to the participation to Amazon
   Robotics Challenge 2017, every experiment has been carried on in
   automatic packing line scenarios, in which Baxter, a humanoid robot
   sporting two 7 DOF arms, had to perform actions avoiding known
   obstacles.},

Abstract = {With the paradigm shift from hospital-centric healthcare to home-centric
   healthcare in Healthcare 4.0, healthcare robotics has become one of the
   fastest growing fields of robotics. The combination of robot
   capabilities with human intelligence, for example, telerobotics for home
   care, is gradually showing promising potentials. In this paper, the
   Home-TeleBot system, a generalized IoT-enabled telerobotic architecture
   designed to support home-centric healthcare system, is proposed. In
   particular, the implementation of it is realized by integrating
   human-motion-capture subsystem with robot-control subsystem. The
   dual-arm cooperative robot, YuMi, imitates human motion captured by a
   set of wearable inertial motion capture devices to complete tasks. The
   proposed approach using workspace mapping and path planning of robot
   manipulators, facilitates telerobot to execute tasks in a natural and
   human-like way. Based on the constant of proportionality calculated by
   comparing the human original workspace with the robot original
   workspace, the workspace mapping is achieved by making assumptions of
   the distance between end-effectors (human hands, robot's grippers) and
   shoulders. Additionally, robot manipulators' path is planned by setting
   virtual obstacles to constrain robot motion, which aims to improve the
   performance of robot's human-like motion. As a specific example of
   application, we apply the proposed architecture to a fetching task based
   on dual-arm motion capture and mapping for telerobotics in home care.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a state-of-art reinforcement learning strategy to
   enable a human-like dual arm mobile robot to deal with some complicated
   tasks with dual arm cooperation. A complex movement task of robot can be
   divided into action phases and subgoals, each of which corresponds to a
   dynamic motion primitive (DMP). During control of the humanoid-like dual
   arm mobile robot, there are some noises that affect the precision of the
   movement of the robot. To deal with those uncertain perturbations while
   handling varying manipulation dynamics for grasping motion, a
   reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with sequences of dynamical motion
   primitives strategy is proposed in this paper. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a two-phase planning has been
   considered in the experiment, namely, the online redundancy resolution
   based on the neural-dynamic optimization algorithm to obtain the initial
   joint trajectories on the first trial, and the reinforcement learning of
   DMP in the learning process, where DMP is used to model the joint
   trajectories, and then reinforcement learning is employed to adjust the
   model to suppress uncertain perturbations.},

Abstract = {The paper deals with modeling of human-like reaching movements in
   dynamic environments. A simple but not trivial example of reaching in a
   dynamic environment is the rest-to-rest manipulation of a multi-mass
   flexible object with the elimination of residual vibrations. Two
   approaches to the prediction of reaching movements are formulated in
   position and force actuation settings. In the first approach, either the
   position of the hand or the hand force is specified by the lowest order
   polynomial satisfying the boundary conditions of the reaching task. The
   second approach is based on the minimization of either the hand jerk or
   the hand force-change, with taking into account the dynamics of the
   flexible object. To verify the resulting four mathematical models, an
   experiment on the manipulation of a ten-masses flexible object of low
   stiffness is conducted. The experimental results show that the second
   approach gives a significantly better prediction of human movements,
   with the minimum hand force-change model having a slight but consistent
   edge over the minimum hand jerk one.},

Title = {Anti-Slip Gait Planning for a Humanoid Robot in Fast Walking},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Humanoid robots are expected to have broad applications due to their
   biped mobility and human-like shape. To increase the walking speed, it
   is necessary to increase the power for driving the joints of legs.
   However, the resulting mass increasing of the legs leads to a rotational
   slip when a robot is walking fast. In this paper, a 3D three-mass model
   is proposed, in which both the trunk and thighs are regarded as an
   inverted pendulum, and the shanks and feet are considered as mass-points
   under no constraints with the trunk. Then based on the model, a friction
   constraint method is proposed to plan the trajectory of the swing leg in
   order to achieve the fastest walking speed without any rotational slip.
   Furthermore, the compensation for zero-moment point (ZMP) is calculated
   based on the 3D three-mass model, and the hip trajectory is obtained
   based on the compensated ZMP trajectory by using the preview control
   method, thus improving the robot's overall ZMP follow-up effect. This
   planning method involves simple calculations but reliable results.
   Finally, simulations confirm that the rotational slip is avoided while
   stable and fast walking is realized, with free joints of the waist and
   arms, which then could be planned for other tasks.},

Abstract = {Throwing is a rapid coordinated movement with high configuration and
   actuation redundancies. Based on a previous work, this paper advances a
   numerical framework that optimizes the throwing motions and generates
   the associated dynamic features for a whole-body humanoid mechanism. To
   generate physically feasible throwing motions in a fully predictive
   manner, rigorous dynamic models, such as actuation, biped balance based
   on Zero-Moment Point (ZMP), and ground reaction loads, are associated
   with the constraints. The algorithm outputs include the motion, required
   actuator torques, release parameters, and object projectile. Realistic
   human-like motions of sidearm and maximum distance throwing are
   generated as optimized solutions, which demonstrate valid kinematic and
   dynamic cause-effect relations. The sidearm throw shows better
   optimality than the overarm throw in terms of actuator torques under the
   proposed mechanical model; it is characterized by the unique hand
   trajectory and effective utilization of torso axial rotation. The
   maximum distance throw is associated with active movement of the arm and
   torso with larger ranges of motion; it is the release height and speed
   that increase accordingly. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Following its applications on reception, space exploration, health care,
   and others, the dual-arm robot is employed for industrial automation
   more intensively these days. With a human-like two-arm structure of high
   degrees of freedom, it should be a strong competitor for industrial
   tasks of high complexity. However, up to date, its deployment is still
   far behind the traditional single-arm robot manipulator. It may be
   partially due to its higher price and larger installation space.
   Meanwhile, the lack of proper methods or devices to deal with task
   planning and teaching that usually involves robot motions of more than
   10 DOF is also influential. Motivated by it, in this paper, we propose a
   novel manipulation system for the industrial dual-arm robot manipulator
   using virtual reality (VR). Especially, we propose taking advantage of
   the similarity between the dual-arm robot and human arm and come up with
   a human-like path planner, with an intention to incorporate that of
   human into robot path planning. In addition, we also furnish the system
   with several assistive tools, including that for physical behavior
   emulation and self-collision detection. Simulations based on realistic
   environments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed manipulation system, along with the questionnaires to evaluate
   user's responses.},

Abstract = {In our research center, we have developed a nursing-care assistant
   robot. This robot can lift up and transfer patient between bed and
   wheelchair using two human like arms. In this research, in order to
   generate comfortable lift-up motion automatically for this robot, we
   proposed a new method by reducing patient's load and pain feeling during
   lifting-up. We developed a musculoskeletal model to estimate muscle
   force, which shows the load of human body. A stiffness sensor was also
   developed to measure the softness distribution of human body. Contact
   human body on soft place can make people feel less pain. In simulation,
   we estimate human posture and comfortable robot motion by minimizing
   muscle force and contacting human body on the softest places. In
   experiments, the measured subjects' postures were compared with the
   estimated value using the estimated motions. Measured postures were very
   close to simulation, which shows the effectiveness of proposed method.},

Abstract = {Human-like planning skills and dexterous manipulation have long posed
   challenges in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).
   The task of reinterpreting calligraphy presents a formidable challenge,
   as it involves the decomposition of strokes and dexterous utensil
   control. Previous efforts have primarily focused on supervised learning
   of a single instrument, limiting the performance of robots in the realm
   of cross-domain text replication. To address these challenges, we
   propose CalliRewrite: a coarse-to-fine approach for robot arms to
   discover and recover plausible writing orders from diverse calligraphy
   images without requiring labeled demonstrations. Our model achieves
   fine-grained control of various writing utensils. Specifically, an
   unsupervised image-to-sequence model decomposes a given calligraphy
   glyph to obtain a coarse stroke sequence. Using an RL algorithm, a
   simulated brush is fine-tuned to generate stylized trajectories for
   robotic arm control. Evaluation in simulation and physical robot
   scenarios reveals that our method successfully replicates unseen fonts
   and styles while achieving integrity in unknown characters. To access

Abstract = {Traditional joint-link robots have been widely used in production lines

Abstract = {As humanoid robots start entering to the human beings environments, the
   collision between the robot and other objects is inevitable. To solve
   this problem, we propose the human mimicking push-recovery strategy.
   With the arm mechanism, the humanoid robot utilizes human-like
   strategies to deal with the unexpected collision. We analyse the human
   push-recovery movement to the external force. Thus we can design the
   trajectory generator to mimic human beings reactions. To reduce the
   modelling error and improve zmp stability, we utilizes the five-mass
   with angular momentum model as humanoid robot model. We design the safe
   bound examination and the Center of Mass (COM) state estimator to judge
   the collision stage. The safe bound examination is used to guarantee the
   walking stability. Moreover, the COM state estimator is used to
   determine whether the pushing is over or not. The push-recovery control
   system is implemented on the humanoid robot developed in our NTU-iCeiRA
   lab. The purpose of this paper aims to integrate different push-recovery
   strategies while encountering different collision conditions based on
   the five-mass with angular momentum model.},

Abstract = {Imitation learning is an efficient framework that allows anthropomorphic
   robotic arms to synthesize human like movements. However, the synthesis
   of the exactly same movements as learned ones is not helpful in real
   environments since the environments are different from the one where the
   movements were learned. For instance, a robotic arm learns the movement
   of manipulating an object by observing a human manipulating the object.
   This movement that is precisely same as learned one cannot be reused in
   the new situations since the the locations of the object are varied.
   Therefore, synthesis of a movement that not only looks natural and but
   also is adaptive to the new environment is necessary for the
   anthropomorphic robotic arm that completes a specific task. This paper
   describes a novel approach to synthesizing natural movements for the
   anthropomorphic robotic arm based on the maintained demonstrations given
   by its human partners. The anthropomorphic robotic arm is trained
   through kinesthetic demonstrations by its human partner, encodes the
   demonstrations into stochastic models, and synthesizes new movements
   dependent on the current environment. The proposed approach designs the
   objective function which evaluates the similarity between the
   synthesized movement and maintained demonstration, and the satisfaction
   of being kinematically constrained to the environment. The movement that
   maximizes this objective function can be found, and consequently the
   anthropomorphic robotic arm can reproduce the adaptive movement to the
   current environment such that it can accomplish a specific task.},

Abstract = {Most functional reaching activities in daily living generally require a
   hand to reach the functional position in appropriate orientation with
   invariant spatiotemporal profile. Effectively reproducing such
   spatiotemporal feature of hand configuration trajectory in real time is
   essential to understand the human motor control and plan human-like
   motion on anthropomorphic robotic arm. However, there are no novel
   computational models in literature toward reproducing hand
   configuration-to-configuration movement in spatiotemporal profile. In
   response to the problem, this paper presents a computational framework
   for hand configuration trajectory formation based on hierarchical
   principle of human motor control. The composite potential field is
   constructed on special Euclidean Group to induce time-varying
   configuration toward target. The dynamic behavior of hand is described
   by a second-order kinematic model to produce the external representation
   of high-level motor control. The multivariate regression relation
   between intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates of arm, is statistically
   analyzed for determining the arm orientation in real time, which
   produces the external representation of low-level motor control. The
   proposed method is demonstrated in an anthropomorphic arm by performing
   several highly curved self-reaching movements. The generated
   configuration trajectories are compared with actual human movement in
   spatiotemporal profile to validate the proposed method.},

Abstract = {The paper concentrates on the development and control of the humanoid

   environment. Optical torque sensors integrated into each joint enable
   measurement of contacting forces along the entire manipulator surface. A
   variable admittance control strategy was elaborated to increase the
   robot functionality and to achieve the human-like dynamics of
   interaction. The experimental results show that the proposed approach
   not only provides safe interaction of the robot arm with a person, but
   also improves the effectiveness of contact task performance. The paper
   also presents a novel concept of avoidance of an obstacle of unknown
   shape. The tactile sensory ability of the developed manipulator allows
   robot links to follow the object contour and to perform motion planning
   in the dynamic environment. The information on the applied normal force
   vector, object shape and target point coordinates is supplied to the
   motion planning system. The algorithms for contact point detection,
   object geometry recognition, and estimation of contacting object
   stiffness are detailed. The numerical simulation elicits a capability of
   the proposed method to approximate various object shapes precisely. The
   experimental results showed that the local admittance control and motion
   planner allowed the end-effector to follow the object contour in a very
   smooth, consistent manner while reaching the target point. (C)

Abstract = {In the era of Industry 4.0, collaborative robots have been one of the
   main pillars enabling flexible automation. This paper investigates the
   benefits of integrating a dual-arm collaborative robot system in a smart

   components. The presented work addresses the design considerations and
   overall hardware and software architecture of Little Helper 7, a
   collaborative robot system which consists of commercial off-the-shelf
   components, and ROS as a middleware for data communication, motion
   planning, 3D vision, and control. Preliminary experiments performed with
   Little Helper 7, demonstrate promising system capabilities such as path
   planning for both arms for synchronous movement while avoiding collision

Abstract = {Sensing and manipulation of small objects are among the most
   challenging, requiring a very high degree of coordinated actuation in
   producing assembly work robots. It is inevitable for the development of
   a robot that is designed to execute complex tasks to apply multiple
   sensors for determination of a target's attributes. In this study, a
   seven-link dual-arm robot with three-fingered hands that exhibits
   human-like skills to manipulate small parts like nuts and bolts is
   proposed. The dynamical system of the robot requires attention in many
   aspects including control, sensor integration, image processing and
   trajectory planning strategies for small object manipulation. In this
   paper, the implementation of sensor integration between force and vision
   sensors for real-time autonomous grasping and screwing of an M10 nut and
   bolt by the robot is discussed. The measured data on the object or
   environment is used to create the robot's trajectory in real-time
   operation and to ensure safety of the robot. The proposed method applies
   a visual servoing structure for the recognition by camera, and impedance
   control for the hand robot to produce softness to the fingers. The
   required kinematics adjustments to modify the trajectories of arms and
   the robot hand's configuration are applied according to the measured
   data by the sensors. Experimental results indicate the performance of
   the proposed method in achieving the sensor-based planning and control
   for fully autonomous screwing task in real-time experiments. This shows
   the capability of the dual-manipulator hand robot for manipulating small
   objects and its applicability for more complex assembly tasks in the

   capturing the human hand workspace using a sensorized glove and mapping
   it to the mechanical hand workspace, reducing the space dimension by
   looking for the most relevant principal motion directions, and planning
   the hand movements using a probabilistic roadmap planner. The approach
   has been implemented for a four finger anthropomorphic mechanical hand

Abstract = {In human-made scenarios, robots need to be able to fully operate objects
   in their surroundings, i.e., objects are required to be functionally
   grasped rather than only picked. This imposes very strict constraints on
   the object pose such that a direct grasp can be performed. Inspired by
   the anthropomorphic nature of humanoid robots, we propose an approach
   that first grasps an object with one hand, obtaining full control over
   its pose, and performs the functional grasp with the second hand
   subsequently. Thus, we develop a fully autonomous pipeline for dual-arm
   functional regrasping of novel familiar objects, i.e., objects never
   seen before that belong to a known object category, e.g., spray bottles.
   This process involves semantic segmentation, object pose estimation,
   non-rigid mesh registration, grasp sampling, handover pose generation
   and in-hand pose refinement. The latter is used to compensate for the
   unpredictable object movement during the first grasp. The approach is
   applied to a human-like upper body. To the best knowledge of the
   authors, this is the first system that exhibits autonomous bimanual
   functional regrasping capabilities. We demonstrate that our system
   yields reliable success rates and can be applied on-line to real-world
   tasks using only one off-the-shelf RGB-D sensor.},

Abstract = {A key problem in robotics is enabling an autonomous agent to perform
   human-like arm movements in close proximity to another human. However,
   modeling the human decision and control process of the movement during
   dyadic interaction presents a challenge. Although, most prior approaches
   rely on multicomponent robot motion planning architectures, we use data
   of two humans performing interfering arm reaching movements to extract
   and transfer interaction behavior control skill to a robotic agent. A
   recurrent neural network-based framework is constructed to learn a
   policy that computes control signals for a robot end effector in order
   to replace one human. The learned policy is benchmarked against unseen
   interaction data and a state-of-the-art learning from demonstration
   framework in simulated scenarios. We compare several architectures and
   investigate a new activation function of three stacked tanh(). The
   results show that the proposed framework successfully learns a policy to
   imitate human movement behavior control during dyadic interaction. The
   policy is transferred to a real robot and its feasibility for
   close-proximity human-robot interaction is shown.},

Abstract = {Traditional industrial robots are generally massive, heavy, and
   dangerous and are therefore generally isolated from humans.
   Collaborative robots or COBOTs are designed to collaborate and work with
   humans in a shared workspace. These are typically smaller and lighter
   than traditional industrial robots and are therefore more flexible and
   easier to deploy in a variety of settings. One of the most crucial
   problems that need to be addressed for cobots is Dynamic Obstacle
   Avoidance as they will be working in an environment where there will be
   constant human movement. This paper presents an efficient solution to
   this problem employing a Non-Linear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC)
   for real-time path planning. It has been used to obtain the most optimum
   trajectory while avoiding dynamic obstacles. The KINOVA Gen3 manipulator
   has been simulated with static and dynamic obstacle modelling. The NMPC
   controls the arm to minimize differences between the system's current
   state and the desired goal position while avoiding obstacles. A detailed
   visualization of the system motion has also been included. The work has
   been tested and the results have been shown for 4 different cases -
   reference case with no obstacles, case 1 with three obstacles, case 2
   with four obstacles and case 3 with a simulated human-like obstacle to
   mimic a typical cobot scenario. Detailed error analysis including
   end-effector and implementation errors has also been shown for each of
   the 4 cases and is promising.},

   dynamics is simplified to a planar two-link robot with actuation only at

   the stiffness of the arm. The objective is to accelerate the ball from
   an initial configuration at rest in such a way that the projection of
   its velocity along a certain elevation angle is maximal at a predefined
   release line. The suggested procedure makes use of a parameterization of
   the robot motion in terms of geometric relations among the generalized
   coordinates. We systematically formulate a necessary condition for an
   optimal motion resulting in a nonlinear differential equation that
   describes a synchronization of the joint angles. A suitable solution is
   found by numerically searching over a finite number of free initial

Title = {An adaptive spinal-like controller: tunable biomimetic behavior for a
   robotic limb},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Background: Spinal-like regulators have recently been shown to support
   complex behavioral patterns during volitional goal-oriented reaching
   paradigms. We use an interpretation of the adaptive spinal-like
   controller as inspiration for the development of a controller for a
   robotic limb. It will be demonstrated that a simulated robot arm with
   linear actuators can achieve biological-like limb movements. In
   addition, it will be shown that programmability in the regulator enables
   independent spatial and temporal changes to be defined for movement
   tasks, downstream of central commands using sensory stimuli. The
   adaptive spinal-like controller is the first to demonstrate such
   behavior for complex motor behaviors in multi-joint limb movements.
   Methods: The controller is evaluated using a simulated robotic apparatus
   and three goal-oriented reaching paradigms: 1) shaping of trajectory
   profiles during reaching; 2) sensitivity of trajectories to sudden
   perturbations; 3) reaching to a moving target. The experiments were
   designed to highlight complex motor tasks that are omitted in earlier
   studies, and important for the development of improved artificial limb
   control.
   Results: In all three cases the controller was able to reach the targets
   without a priori planning of end-point or segmental motor trajectories.
   Instead, trajectory spatio-temporal dynamics evolve from properties of
   the controller architecture using the spatial error (vector distance to
   goal). Results show that curvature amplitude in hand trajectory paths
   are reduced by as much as 98\% using simple gain scaling techniques,
   while adaptive network behavior allows the regulator to successfully
   adapt to perturbations and track a moving target. An important
   observation for this study is that all motions resemble human-like
   movements with non-linear muscles and complex joint mechanics.
   Conclusions: The controller shows that it can adapt to various
   behavioral contexts which are not included in previous biomimetic
   studies. The research supplements an earlier study by examining the
   tunability of the spinal-like controller for complex reaching tasks.
   This work is a step toward building more robust controllers for powered
   artificial limbs.},

Abstract = {To pour various contents from a container, a robot needs to be able to
   generate a trajectory of its arm, to grasp containers, and to estimate
   the amount poured. We propose a method only based on tactile sensing to
   generate the overall pouring motion including all the required
   abilities. Using a robot arm, we generated a human-like tipping motion
   and developed a grasping strategy to prevent slippage of the robot's
   fingertips for objects whose center of gravity changes while pouring.
   With this method, the robot uses the fingertip forces to estimate the
   amount poured independently of the material being poured and the working
   environment of the robot. By using a tactile-based pouring motion rather
   than a vision-based pouring motion, we expect the robot to achieve a
   general-purpose, robust, and highly accurate pouring motion. We
   evaluated the usefulness of the proposed tactile-based pouring motion
   through pouring experiments where the robot poured the contents from a
   plastic bottle into a cup. The robot pours the three types of materials
   with different particle sizes from a plastic bottle into a cup. The
   results showed that the proposed method enabled the robot to pour the
   contents into the cup while estimating the mass of the poured material
   with an error less than 17 grams.},

Abstract = {Medical robots are increasingly being.used to assist surgeons during
   procedures requiring precision. As reported in the literature, surgeons
   have been opting for minimally invasive surgery, as it reduces patient
   complications, overall patient recovery time, and hospital time for the
   patient. Robotic manipulators can be used to overcome natural
   limitations related to vision and human dexterity, and allow surgeons to
   transcend. these limitations without having to sacrifice improvement in
   patient outcome. A desirable attribute of surgical robots is
   maneuverability similar to the human arm. The KUKA DLR Lightweight Robot
   Arm (LWR), with seven degrees of freedom, retains many of these
   human-like dexterity traits. Due to the KUKA robot arms maneuverability
   and flexibility, it is well-suited for intricate tasks based upon motion
   analyses and modeling of the compliance to path trajectory in addition
   to the overall smoothness of the path. This robot may be further
   programmed to be effective and precise for surgical applications. In the
   studies reported here, a unique Rapidly exploring Randomized Tree (RRT)
   based path planning algorithm is developed and this algorithm is used to
   generate path plans between an initial state and a goal state for
   simulated models of robotic manipulator arms. Along with constraints,
   the RRT algorithm has been implemented to find paths for the chosen
   kinematic or dynamic robotic manipulator arm. Similar techniques are to
   be used to analyze the KUKA LWR IV+ system. Motion analyses have been
   carried out with consideration of motion trajectories and all possible
   locations of the end effector with unique constraints applied to the
   system. In these simulations, the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters were
   recorded, with special attention to movement restrictions. The results
   of the RRT paths generation, analysis of the manipulator arm
   trajectories, and simulations allow one to better determine the location
   of the end-effector at any given point in time and location. From this
   foundation, the generation of path-planning restrictions for the KUKA
   robots path programming is expected to take into account surgically
   restricted dangerous or undesirable zones. In future work, the
   trajectories of the KUKA robot and other manipulator arms are to be
   compared with the data available in the literature. This work holds
   promising implications for the improved use of such robot systems in
   surgical applications. For example, precise pre-programmed robotic
   movements are expected to be particularly helpful for surgeries in
   tight, anatomically restricted sites, with adjacent delicate tissues.
   Ultimately, it is expected that this type of novel robotic application
   will greatly aid surgeons in improving the precision and safety of
   surgical procedures, by reducing potential complications and minimizing
   potential nicks and tears, and working towards giving the surgeons the
   same ease that they have with traditional surgery.},

Abstract = {We propose a motion planning formulation of overarm throw for a

   capture or animation, rigorous dynamics modeling, such as dynamic
   balance based on Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) and ground reaction loads, is
   associated with the constraints. Given the target location and the
   object mass, the algorithm outputs the motion, required actuator
   torques, release conditions, and projectile and flight time of the
   object. Realistic human-like motions of throwing are generated for
   different input parameters, which demonstrate valid cause-effect

Abstract = {The degree of automation in the area of analytical measurements is still
   low-in contrast to well-automated bioscreening and high-throughput
   screening applications. Typical analytical measurement processes are
   very complex and involve transportation, sample preparation including
   direct manipulation and operation of laboratory devices as well as
   measurement and data evaluation. A wide variety of vessels and
   containers is used for chemicals and samples; the processes are often
   changing and have to be modified frequently. The demand for flexible and
   adaptable automation solutions is high. Flexibility includes the use of
   multiple instruments-conventional manual instruments and automation
   equipment-and an easy system change to a wide variety of applications.
   Dual-arm robotic systems captivate by their human like structure and the
   possibility to perform processes in the same way as human laboratory
   assistants. Especially in highly regulated areas, this property may be a
   big advantage since existing manual standard procedures can still be
   used. A dual-arm robotic system is presented for fully automated sample
   preparation and measurement. A new concept for robot motion planning and
   process generation is introduced to increase the system
   performance-processing times and flexibility. The motion planning
   approaches were practically compared by performing a sample preparation
   process with subsequent determination of the enantiomeric excess of
   amino acids. The results show a reduction of the processing time of
   30.3\% with measurement results close to the manual procedure.},

   presents a pipeline that uses a single RGB-D sensor to demonstrate

   the TAICHI algorithm (Tracking Algorithm for Imitation of Complex Human

   mapping them to the robot, applying Gaussian filtering to smooth
   movements and reduce sensor noise, and utilizing an optimization
   algorithm to find the nearest configuration to the human arm while
   avoiding collisions with the environment or the robot itself. The
   novelty of this method lies in its utilization of key points from the
   human arm, specifically the end-effector and elbow, to derive a similar
   configuration for a non-anthropomorphic arm. Through tests encompassing
   various movements performed at different speeds, we have validated the
   efficacy of our method and confirmed its efficiency in replicating the

   planning for redundant manipulators},
Journal = {BIOINSPIRATION \& BIOMIMETICS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {In this work, we address human-like motor planning in redundant
   manipulators. Specifically, we want to capture postural synergies such
   as Donders' law, experimentally observed in humans during kinematically
   redundant tasks, and infer a minimal set of parameters to implement
   similar postural synergies in a kinematic model. For the model itself,
   although the focus of this paper is to solve redundancy by implementing
   postural strategies derived from experimental data, we also want to
   ensure that such postural control strategies do not interfere with other
   possible forms of motion control (in the task-space), i.e. solving the
   posture/movement problem.
   The redundancy problem is framed as a constrained optimization problem,
   traditionally solved via the method of Lagrange multipliers. The
   posture/movement problem can be tackled via the separation principle
   which, derived from experimental evidence, posits that the brain
   processes static torques (i.e. posture-dependent, such as gravitational
   torques) separately from dynamic torques (i.e. velocity-dependent). The
   separation principle has traditionally been applied at a joint torque
   level. Our main contribution is to apply the separation principle to
   Lagrange multipliers, which act as task-space force fields, leading to a
   task-space separation principle. In this way, we can separate postural
   control (implementing Donders' law) from various types of tasks-space
   movement planners.
   As an example, the proposed framework is applied to the (redundant) task
   of pointing with the human wrist. Nonlinear inverse optimization (NIO)
   is used to fit the model parameters and to capture motor strategies
   displayed by six human subjects during pointing tasks. The novelty of
   our NIO approach is that (i) the fitted motor strategy, rather than raw
   data, is used to filter and down-sample human behaviours; (ii) our
   framework is used to efficiently simulate model behaviour iteratively,
   until it converges towards the experimental human strategies.},

   framework based on an extended dynamic movement primitive (DMP) and
   quadratic programming (QP) optimization. The objective is to learn
   kinematic and dynamic operational parameters from a one-shot human
   demonstration, through measurement and estimation of the motion,
   3-dimensional (3-D) endpoint stiffness, and applied forces of the human
   arm during manipulation tasks. To this end, first, the framework
   features an extended DMP to model the motion, stiffness, and force
   variations in Cartesian space and 2-D sphere manifold. Second, to
   account for collected errors and human-robot operation gaps, a QP
   optimization is applied to fine-tune the desired position of the
   controller. Finally, we validate the framework through two experiments
   in real scenarios on the Franka Emika Panda robot. Experimental results
   show that the robot can not only inherit the variation laws of motion,
   stiffness, and force in the human demonstration, but also exhibit
   certain generalization capabilities to other situations. The framework
   provides a reference for robots learning multiple skills via a one-shot
   human demonstration, which finds great potential application in
   human-robot cooperation, contact-rich scenarios, and skillful
   operations, where the motion, stiffness, and applied forces need to be
   considered simultaneously. Note to Practitioners-Fast programming in
   robotics through skill transfer plays a critical role in next-generation
   robots entering ordinary people's lives. Existing research focuses more
   on skill learning at the kinematic level and lacks on the dynamic level,
   such as stiffness and contact force. The goal of this paper is to
   propose a novel framework for robots learning of motion, stiffness, and
   force variations from a one-shot human demonstration, simultaneously. To
   this end, a Riemannian-based DMP method is employed to model the
   variation laws of motion, stiffness, and force in Cartesian space and
   2-D sphere manifold, respectively. In this way, the learning module
   needs to be run only once, and the patterns can also be generalized to
   other targets without repeated robot teaching and additional
   time-consuming processes. To accurately reproduce the learned skills, a
   human-like motion/stiffness/force controller combined with QP
   optimization is investigated. In this paper, rather than identifying
   real environmental parameters, we directly use interacted forces during
   the human demonstration to represent environmental effects and employ QP
   to update the desired position in a limited range to account for
   collected errors and human-robot operation gaps. Experiments on button
   pressing and polishing tasks by the Panda robot have achieved very good
   results. The work of this paper lays a foundation for multiple skills
   learning from human demonstration (LfHD).},

Abstract = {The applications and requirements of a complete robotic arm from
   shoulder to fingers are obvious for hand disabled people. The reported
   research toward hardware development and its operations of a complete
   robotic arm is limited and needs to accelerate for the betterment of
   society. However, it is a very challenging task to design and develop a
   human-like five-fingered robotic arm due to more number of degrees of
   freedom required to provide the sufficient flexibility. It is also
   challenging to ensure precise autonomous motion of the full arm to
   following the reference trajectory in order to approach and grasp the
   object. In this paper, we present the detailed description of the design
   and development of a 20-DOF (3-DOF shoulder, 1-DOF elbow, 1-DOF wrist,
   3-DOF thumb and 3-DOF each finger) robotic arm. The main objectives are
   to develop a human-mimic robotic arm having higher degrees of freedom,
   competitive physical capabilities and able to perform precise motion
   while approaching and grasping an object. The presented robotic arm is
   designed in SolidWorks and implemented using ROS library. The
   mathematical analysis of its kinematics is also provided to design the
   control system and motion planning algorithms as per the requirement. A
   novel motion planning and control algorithm is also introduced to govern
   the motion of the full arm and perform accurate grasping. The
   performance of the developed robotic arm is compared with the existing
   arms on the basis of accuracy in motion while approaching and grasping
   an object. It has been observed that the physical strength of the
   developed arm is quite competitive, while it outperforms others in
   motion accuracy. Results have been verified by the hardware experiments
   and further validated by the statistical technique.},

Abstract = {Performing manipulation tasks interactively in real environments
   requires a high degree of accuracy and stability. At the same time, when
   one cannot assume a fully deterministic and static environment, one must
   endow the robot with the ability to react rapidly to sudden changes in
   the environment. These considerations make the task of reach and grasp
   difficult to deal with. We follow a Programming by Demonstration (PbD)
   approach to the problem and take inspiration from the way humans adapt
   their reach and grasp motions when perturbed. This is in sharp contrast
   to previous work in PbD that uses unperturbed motions for training the
   system and then applies perturbation solely during the testing phase. In
   this work, we record the kinematics of arm and fingers of human subjects
   during unperturbed and perturbed reach and grasp motions. In the
   perturbed demonstrations, the target's location is changed suddenly
   after the onset of the motion. Data show a strong coupling between the
   hand transport and finger motions. We hypothesize that this coupling
   enables the subject to seamlessly and rapidly adapt the finger motion in
   coordination with the hand posture. To endow our robot with this
   competence, we develop a coupled dynamical system based controller,
   whereby two dynamical systems driving the hand and finger motions are
   coupled. This offers a compact encoding for reach-to-grasp motions that
   ensures fast adaptation with zero latency for re-planning. We show in
   simulation and on the real iCub robot that this coupling ensures smooth
   and ``human-like{''} motions. We demonstrate the performance of our
   model under spatial, temporal and grasp type perturbations which show
   that reaching the target with coordinated hand-arm motion is necessary
   for the success of the task. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Our goal is to enable robots to produce motion that is suitable for
   human-robot collaboration and co-existence. Most motion in robotics is
   purely functional, ideal when the robot is performing a task in
   isolation. In collaboration, however, the robot's motion has an
   observer, watching and interpreting the motion. In this work, we move
   beyond functional motion, and introduce the notion of an observer into
   motion planning, so that robots can generate motion that is mindful of
   how it will be interpreted by a human collaborator. We formalize
   predictability and legibility as properties of motion that naturally
   arise from the inferences in opposing directions that the observer
   makes, drawing on action interpretation theory in psychology. We propose
   models for these inferences based on the principle of rational action,
   and derive constrained functional trajectory optimization techniques for
   planning motion that is predictable or legible. Finally, we present
   experiments that test our work on novice users, and discuss the
   remaining challenges in enabling robots to generate such motion online

Abstract = {The musculoskeletal robot is a promising direction of the

   musculoskeletal robots lack multitask learning ability, great
   generalization, and biological plausibility. In this article, a
   motor-cortex-like recurrent neural network (RNN) and a reward-modulated
   multitask learning method are proposed. First, inspired by the dynamic
   system hypothesis of motor cortex, the RNN is introduced to transform
   movement targets into muscle excitations. The condition that makes an
   RNN generate motor-cortex-like consistent population response is
   investigated. Second, a reward-modulated multitask learning method of
   such an RNN is proposed. In the experiments, the control of a
   musculoskeletal system is realized with multitask learning ability,
   great generalization, and robustness for noises. Furthermore, the RNN
   and muscle excitations demonstrate motor-cortex-like consistent
   population response and human-like muscle synergies, respectively.
   Therefore, the proposed method has better performance and biological
   plausibility, and verifies the neural mechanisms in the robotic

Abstract = {A key requirement for seamless human-robot collaboration is for the
   robot to make its intentions clear to its human collaborator. A
   collaborative robot's motion must be legible, or intent-expressive.
   Legibility is often described in the literature as and effect of
   predictable, unsurprising, or expected motion. Our central insight is
   that predictability and legibility are fundamentally different and often
   contradictory properties of motion. We develop a formalism to
   mathematically define and distinguish predictability and legibility of
   motion. We formalize the two based on inferences between trajectories
   and goals in opposing directions, drawing the analogy to action
   interpretation in psychology. We then propose mathematical models for
   these inferences based on optimizing cost, drawing the analogy to the
   principle of rational action. Our experiments validate our formalism's
   prediction that predictability and legibility can contradict, and
   provide support for our models. Our findings indicate that for robots to
   seamlessly collaborate with humans, they must change the way they plan
   their motion.},

Title = {Robot-Assisted Deep Venous Thrombosis Ultrasound Examination Using
   Virtual Fixture},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 12},
Abstract = {Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT) is a common vascular disease with blood
   clots inside deep veins, which may block blood flow or even cause a
   life-threatening pulmonary embolism. A typical exam for DVT using
   ultrasound (US) imaging is by pressing the target vein until its lumen
   is fully compressed. However, the compression exam is highly
   operator-dependent. To alleviate intra-and inter-variations, we present
   a robotic US system with a novel hybrid force motion control scheme
   ensuring position and force tracking accuracy, and soft landing of the
   probe onto the target surface. In addition, a path-based virtual fixture
   is proposed to realize easy human-robot interaction for repeat
   compression operation at the lesion location. To ensure the biometric
   measurements obtained in different examinations are comparable, the 6D
   scanning path is determined in a coarse-to-fine manner using both an
   external RGBD camera and US images. The RGBD camera is first used to
   extract a rough scanning path on the object. Then, the segmented
   vascular lumen from US images are used to optimize the scanning path to
   ensure the visibility of the target object. To generate a continuous
   scan path for developing virtual fixtures, an arc-length based path
   fitting model considering both position and orientation is proposed.
   Finally, the whole system is evaluated on a human-like arm phantom with
   an uneven surface. The code (https://github.com/dianyeHuang/RobDVTUS)

Abstract = {To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared
   workspaces, it is important for the robot to predict how a human will
   move when performing a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not
   known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching
   motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially
   relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses
   underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the
   trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost
   function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion
   can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost
   function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function that
   ``explains{''} the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example
   trajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative
   assembly task using motion capture. We then use inverse optimal control
   to learn a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict
   reaching motions from the human's current configuration to a task-space
   goal region by iteratively replanning a trajectory using the learned
   cost function. Our planning algorithm is based on the trajectory
   optimizer: stochastic trajectory optimizer for motion planning {[}1]; it
   plans for a 23-degree-of-freedom human kinematic model and accounts for
   the presence of a moving collaborator and obstacles in the environment.
   Our results suggest that in most cases, our method outperforms baseline
   methods when predicting motions. We also show that our method
   outperforms baselines for predicting human motion when a human and a
   robot share the workspace.},

Abstract = {When a robot approaches a person, the chosen trajectory ideally informs
   the person not only about the robot's intended target location, but also
   its intended orientation. However, planning a straight line to the goal
   location does not guarantee a correct final orientation, potentially
   causing confusion as the robot eventually rotates towards its
   unsuspecting target. One method that could remedy this problem is
   minimum jerk path planning, which results in the smoothest possible path
   that ends in the pre-specified final orientation. The technique is
   already widely used in robotic arm motion planning, but existing work is
   lacking for regular path planning. The aim of the current study is to
   implement minimum jerk path planning for the Nao robot and to evaluate
   the potential benefit for human observers to infer the intended target
   of the robot. Results show that minimum jerk path planning significantly
   improves people's recognition of the robot's destination compared to
   straight line path planning Meanwhile, the perceived likeability and
   human likeness of the robot remain the same, suggesting that
   implementing smooth robot path planning that includes the final
   orientation leads to more predictable robot approaching behaviour.},

Abstract = {Naturally, finding joint trajectories for robotic manipulators involves
   competing optimization goals. On the one hand, the end-effector should
   move along a predictable and short path while on the other hand joint
   movement and acceleration should be kept to a minimum. Obstacles in the
   workspace or joint limits complicate the situation even further.
   Constructing a metric that makes undesired configurations more expensive
   to travel through, we equip the joint space with a notion of cost. The
   motion planning task then reduces to the problem of finding cheapest
   paths connecting two configurations - so-called geodesics. We show how
   to construct suitable metrics for a variety of typical scenarios and
   present an efficient algorithm for the computation of the corresponding
   geodesics. Our approach makes it very easy to balance different
   optimization goals and produces natural and smooth manipulator movement.},

Abstract = {Coordinated control strategies for multi-robot systems are necessary for
   tasks that cannot be executed by a single robot. This encompasses tasks
   where the workspace of the robot is too small or where the load is too
   heavy for one robot to handle. Using multiple robots makes the task
   feasible by extending the workspace and/or increase the payload of the
   overall robotic system. In this paper, we consider two instances of such
   tasks: a co-worker scenario in which a human hands over a large object
   to a robot; intercepting a large flying object. The problem is made
   difficult as the pick-up/intercept motions must take place while the
   object is in motion and because the object's motion is not
   deterministic. The challenge is then to adapt the motion of the robotic
   arms in coordination with one another and with the object. Determining
   the pick-up/intercept point is done by taking into account the workspace
   of the multi-arm system. The point is continuously recomputed to adapt
   to change in the object's trajectory. We propose a virtual object based
   dynamical systems (DS) control law to generate autonomous and
   synchronized motions for a multi-arm robot system. We show theoretically
   that the multi-arm + virtual object system converges asymptotically to
   the moving object. We validate our approach on a dual-arm robotic system
   and demonstrate that it can resynchronize and adapt the motion of each
   arm in a fraction of a second, even when the motion of the object is
   fast and not accurately predictable.},

Abstract = {Multisection continuum arms are bio-inspired manipulators that combine
   compliance, payload, dexterity, and safety to serve as co-robots in
   human-robot collaborative domains. Their hyper redundancy and complex
   kinematics, however, pose many challenges when performing path planning,
   especially in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present a W-Space
   based Rapidly Exploring Random Trees {*} path planner for multisection
   continuum arm robots in dynamic environments. The proposed planner
   improves the existing state-of-art planners in terms of computation time
   and the success rate, while removing the need for offline computation.
   On average, the computation time of our approach is below 2 seconds, and
   its average success rate is around 70\%. The computation time of the
   proposed planner significantly improves that of the state-of-the-art
   planner by roughly a factor of 20, making the former suitable for
   real-time applications. Moreover, for application domains where the
   obstacle motion is not very predictable (e.g., human obstacles), the
   proposed planner significantly improves the success rate of
   state-of-the-art planners by nearly 50\%. Lastly, we demonstrate the
   feasibility of several generated trajectories by replicating the motion
   on a physical prototype arm.},

   not well known. The purpose of this study was to understand how local
   limb movements of another pedestrian affect the planning and execution
   to circumvent them. Ten healthy young adults (24.5 +/- 3.0 years) were
   immersed in a virtual environment representing a shopping mall.
   Participants walked to a shop located directly in front of them while
   circumventing a virtual agent which, when present, approached from
   straight ahead with one of four different locomotor patterns: 1-Normal
   locomotor movements; 2- No arm movements; 3- No leg movements; 4- No arm
   and leg movements (gliding to them). Circumvention trajectory, minimum
   clearance and coordination of head and trunk rotations along with center
   of mass lateral displacement were examined. Nonparametric Analysis of
   Longitudinal Data was used to compare variables across the different
   conditions. Minimum clearance was smaller for normal locomotor movements
   compared to all other conditions, but coordination of body movements and
   onset of circumvention trajectory deviations remained unchanged. These
   results suggest that global body movement is sufficient to plan
   circumvention trajectories in a predictable avoidance task, but
   clearance safety margins are influenced by the local limb movements of
   another pedestrian.},

Abstract = {The use of coordinated multi-arm robotic systems allows to preform
   manipulations of heavy or bulky objects that would otherwise be
   infeasible for a single-arm robot. This paper concisely introduces our
   work on coordinated multi-arm control {[}Salehian et al., 2016a], where
   we proposed a virtual object based dynamical systems (DS) control law to
   generate autonomous and synchronized motions for a multi-arm robot
   system. We show theoretically and empirically that the multi-arm +
   virtual object system converges asymptotically to a moving object. The
   proposed framework is validated on a dual-arm robotic system. We
   demonstrate that it can re-synchronize and adapt the motion of each arm
   in a fraction of a second, even when the object's motion is fast and not
   accurately predictable.},

Abstract = {Dual-arm manipulation is an increasingly important skill for robots
   operating in home, retail and industrial environments. Dual-arm
   manipulation is especially essential for tasks involving large objects
   which are harder to grasp and manipulate using a single arm. In this
   work, we address dual-arm manipulation of objects in indoor
   environments. We are particularly focused on tasks that involve an
   upright orientation constraint on the grasped object. Such constraints
   are often present in human environments, e. g. when manipulating a tray
   of food or a container with fluids. In this paper, we present a
   search-based approach that is capable of planning dual-arm motions,
   often within one second, in cluttered environments while adhering to the
   orientation constraints. Our approach systematically constructs a graph
   in task space and generates motions that are consistent across runs with
   similar start/goal configurations and are low-cost. These motions come
   with guarantees on completeness and bounds on the suboptimality with
   respect to the graph that encodes the planning problem. For many
   problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it
   helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human
   interacting with the robot.},

Abstract = {To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared
   workspaces, it is important for the robot to predict how a human will
   move when performing a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not
   known a priori is very challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching
   motions for known tasks in collaborative settings (which are especially
   relevant for manufacturing) are indeed predictable. Two hypotheses
   underlie our approach for predicting such motions: First, that the
   trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect to an unknown cost
   function, and second, that human adaptation to their partner's motion
   can be captured well through iterative replanning with the above cost
   function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function which
   ``explains{''} the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example
   trajectories from two participants performing a collaborative assembly
   task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn
   a cost function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict a human's
   motion for a given task by iteratively replanning a trajectory for a 23
   DoF human kinematic model using the STOMP algorithm with the learned
   cost function in the presence of a moving collaborator. Our results
   suggest that our method outperforms baseline methods and generalizes
   well for tasks similar to those that were demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Intrinsic motivation is one of the keys in implementing the mechanism of
   interest to robots. In this paper, we present a method to apply
   intrinsic motivation in dynamics learning with predictable and
   unpredictable targets in view. The robot's arm is used for the
   predictable target and the human's arm is used for the unpredictable
   target in the experiment. The learning algorithm based on intrinsic
   motivation will automatically set a larger weight to targets that would
   contribute to decreasing the training error, while setting a smaller
   weight to others. A neurodynamical model, namely multiple timescales
   recurrent neural network (MTRNN), is utilized for studying the robot's
   arm/external object dynamics. Training of MTRNN is done using the back
   propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm. We modify the BPTT algorithm
   by the following two steps. (1) Evaluate predictability of robot's
   arm/objects using training error of MTRNN. (2) Assign a preference
   ratio, which represents the weight of the training, to each object based
   on predictability. The proposed training method would focus more on
   reducing training error of predictable objects compared to normal BPTT,
   where training error is equally treated for every object. Experiments
   were conducted using an actual robot platform, moving the robot's arm
   while a human moves his arm in the robot's camera view. The results of
   the experiment showed that the proposed training method could achieve
   smaller training error of the robot's arm visuomotor dynamics, which is
   predictable from the robot's motor command, compared to general training
   with BPTT. Evaluation of MTRNN as a forward model to predict untrained
   data showed that the proposed model is capable of predicting the robot's
   hand motion, specifically with larger number of nodes.},

Title = {Single- and dual-arm motion planning with heuristic search},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {33},
Number = {2},
Pages = {305-320},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Heuristic searches such as the A{*} search are a popular means of
   finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical
   guarantees on completeness and optimality, simplicity in implementation
   and consistent behavior. In planning for robotic manipulation, however,
   these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high
   dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a
   heuristic search-based approach to motion planning for manipulation that
   does deal effectively with the high dimensionality of the problem. Our
   approach achieves the necessary efficiency by exploiting the following
   three key principles: (a) representation of the planning problem with
   what we call a manipulation lattice graph; (b) use of the ARA{*} search
   which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution
   suboptimality; and (c) use of informative yet fast-to-compute
   heuristics. The paper presents the approach together with its
   theoretical properties and shows how to apply it to single-arm and
   dual-arm motion planning with upright constraints on a PR2 robot
   operating in non-trivial cluttered spaces. An extensive experimental
   analysis in both simulation and on a physical PR2 shows that, in terms
   of runtime, our approach is on a par with other most common
   sampling-based approaches despite the high dimensionality of the
   problems. In addition, the experimental analysis shows that due to its
   deterministic cost minimization, the approach generates motions that are
   of good quality and are consistent, in other words, the resulting plans
   tend to be similar for similar tasks. For many problems, the consistency
   of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of
   the robot more predictable for a human controlling or interacting with
   the robot.},

   Manipulator Using Topological Path Planning},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Industrial applications with robotic manipulators have grown and made
   production systems increasingly efficient. However, there are still some
   limitations that can delay production, causing losses. Several factors,
   such as accidents and collisions of manipulator robots with operators
   and other machines, can cause unforeseen stops. Thus, this work aims to
   develop a trajectory planning method to avoid collisions applied to a
   selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA) robotic manipulator in
   the context of collaborative robotics. The main contribution of this
   paper is a path planning method based on mathematical morphology, named
   topological path planning (TPP). Through some evaluation metrics such as
   the number of path points, computing time, distance, standard deviation
   of the joint acceleration, and maximum acceleration rate along the path,
   we show that TPP is a collision-free, deterministic, and predictable
   route planning. In our experiments, our proposal presented better
   results for applications in industrial robotic manipulators when
   compared to the probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) and TPP{*}, a
   particular case of TPP that is similar to the generalized Voronoi
   diagram (GVD).},

Abstract = {For robots acting - and failing - in everyday environments, a
   predictable behaviour representation is important so that it can be
   utilised for failure analysis, recovery, and subsequent improvement.
   Learning from demonstration combined with dynamic motion primitives is
   one commonly used technique for creating models that are easy to analyse
   and interpret; however, mobile manipulators complicate such models since
   they need the ability to synchronise arm and base motions for performing
   purposeful tasks. In this paper, we analyse dynamic motion primitives in
   the context of a mobile manipulator - a Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR)
   - and introduce a small extension of dynamic motion primitives that
   makes it possible to perform whole body motion with a mobile
   manipulator. We then present an extensive set of experiments in which
   our robot was grasping various everyday objects in a domestic
   environment, where a sequence of object detection, pose estimation, and
   manipulation was required for successfully completing the task. Our
   experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed whole body
   motion framework for everyday object manipulation, but also illustrate
   the necessity for highly adaptive manipulation strategies that make
   better use of a robot's perceptual capabilities.},

Abstract = {Robots learn as they interact with humans. Consider a human
   teleoperating an assistive robot arm: as the human guides and corrects
   the arm's motion, the robot gathers information about the human's
   desired task. But how does the human know what their robot has inferred?
   Today's approaches often focus on conveying intent: for instance, using
   legible motions or gestures to indicate what the robot is planning.
   However, closing the loop on robot inference requires more than just
   revealing the robot's current policy: the robot should also display the
   alternatives it thinks are likely, and prompt the human teacher when
   additional guidance is necessary. In this letter we propose a multimodal
   approach for communicating robot inference that combines both passive
   and active feedback. Specifically, we leverage information-rich
   augmented reality to passively visualize what the robot has inferred,
   and attention-grabbing haptic wristbands to actively prompt and direct
   the human's teaching. We apply our system to shared autonomy tasks where
   the robot must infer the human's goal in real-time. Within this context,
   we integrate passive and active modalities into a single algorithmic
   framework that determines when and which type of feedback to provide.
   Combining both passive and active feedback experimentally outperforms
   single modality baselines; during an in-person user study, we
   demonstrate that our integrated approach increases how efficiently
   humans teach the robot while simultaneously decreasing the amount of
   time humans spend interacting with the robot. Videos here:

Abstract = {Motion generation seeks to produce safe and feasible robot motion from
   start to goal. Various tools at different levels of granularity have
   been developed. On one extreme, sampling-based motion planners focus on
   completeness - a solution, if it exists, would eventually be found.
   However, produced paths are often of low quality, and contain
   superfluous motion. On the other, reactive methods optimise the
   immediate cost to obtain the next controls, producing smooth and legible
   motion that can quickly adapt to perturbations, uncertainties, and
   changes in the environment. However, reactive methods are highly local,
   and often produce motion that become trapped in non-convex regions of
   the environment. This paper contributes, Geometric Fabric Command
   Sequences, a method that lies in the middle ground. It can produce
   globally optimal motion that is smooth and intuitive, while being also
   reactive. We model motion via a reactive Geometric Fabric policy that
   ingests a sequence of attractor states, or commands, and then apply
   global optimisation over the space of commands. We postulate that
   solutions for different problems and scenes are highly transferable when
   conditioned on environmental features. Therefore, an implicit generative
   model is trained on solutions from optimisation and environment features
   in a self-supervised manner. That is, faced with multiple motion
   generation problems, the learning and optimisation are contained within
   the same loop: the optimisation generates labels for learning, while the
   learning improves the optimisation for the next problem, which in turn
   provides higher quality labels. We empirically validate our method in
   both simulation and on a real-world 6-DOF JACO arm.},

Abstract = {Cognitive neuroscience, traditionally focused on individual brains, is
   just beginning to investigate social cognition through realistic
   interpersonal interaction. However, quantitative investigation of the
   dynamical sensorimotor communication among interacting individuals in
   goal-directed ecological tasks is particularly challenging. Here, we
   recorded upper-body motion capture of 23 dyads, alternating their
   leader/ follower role, in a tower-building task. Either a strategy of
   joining efforts or a strategy of independent action could in principle
   be used. We found that arm reach velocity profiles of participants
   tended to converge across trials. Automatic imitation of low-level motor
   control parameters demonstrates that the task is achieved through
   continuous action coordination as opposed to independent action
   planning. Moreover, the leader produced more consistent and predictable
   velocity profiles, suggesting an implicit strategy of signaling to the
   follower. This study serves as a validation of our joint goal-directed
   non-verbal task for future applications. In fact, the quantification of
   human-to-human continuous sensorimotor interaction, in a way that can be
   predicted and controlled, is probably one of the greatest challenges for
   the future of human-robot interaction.},

Title = {Dynamic navigation-guided robotic placement of zygomatic implants},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {153},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of a new prototype
   robotic implant system for the placement of zygomatic implants in
   edentulous maxillary models. Methods: The study was carried out on eight
   plastic models. Cone beam computed tomographs were captured for each
   model to plan the positions of zygomatic implants. The hand-eye
   calibration technique was used to register the dynamic navigation system
   to the robotic spaces. A total of 16 zygomatic implants were placed,
   equally distributed between the anterior and the posterior parts of the
   zygoma. The placement of the implants (ZYGAN (R), Southern Implants) was
   carried out using an active six-jointed robotic arm (UR3e, Universal
   Robots) guided by the dynamic navigation coordinate transformation
   matrix. The accuracy of the implant placement was assessed using
   EvaluNav and GeoMagicDesignX (R) software based on pre- and
   post-operative CBCT superimposition. Descriptive statistics for the
   implant deviations and Pearson's correlation analysis of these
   deviations to force feedback recorded by the robotic arm were conducted.
   Results: The 3D deviations at the entry and exit points were 1.80 f 0.96
   mm and 2.80 f 0.95 mm, respectively. The angular deviation was 1.74 f
   0.92 degrees. The overall registration time was 23.8 f 7.0 min for each
   side of the model. Operative time excluding registration was 66.8 f 8.8
   min for each trajectory. The exit point and angular deviations of the
   implants were positively correlated with the drilling force
   perpendicular to the long axis of the handpiece and negatively
   correlated with the drilling force parallel to the long axis of the
   handpiece. Conclusion: The errors of the dynamic navigation-guided
   robotic placement of zygomatic implants were within the clinically
   acceptable limits. Further refinements are required to facilitate the
   clinical application of the tested integrated robotic-dynamic navigation
   system. Clinical significance: Robotic placement of zygomatic implants
   has the potential to produce a highly predictable outcome irrespective
   of the operator's surgical experience or fatigue. The presented study
   paves the way for clinical applications.},
